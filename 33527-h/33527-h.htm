<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>In March 1972, the Naval Undersea Center (NUC), San Diego, Calif. in cooperation with the National
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Tiburon, Calif. published a photographic field guide&mdash;<i>The Whales, Dolphins
and Porpoises of the Eastern North Pacific. A Guide to Their Identification in the Water</i>, by S. Leatherwood,
W.E. Evans, and D.W. Rice (NUC TP 282). This guide was designed to assist the layman in identifying the
cetaceans he encountered in that area and was intended for use in two ongoing whale observer programs,
NUC's Whale Watch and NMFS's Platforms of Opportunity. The rationale of these programs was that since
oceanographers, commercial and sport fishermen, naval personnel, commercial seamen, pleasure boaters, and
coastal aircraft pilots together canvas large areas of the oceans which scientists specializing in whales
(cetologists) have time and funds to survey only occasionally, training those persons in species identification
and asking them to report their sightings back to central data centers could help scientists more clearly
understand distribution, migration, and seasonal variations in abundance of cetacean species. For such a
program to work, a usable field guide is a requisite. Because the many publications on the whales, dolphins, and
porpoises of this region were either too technical in content or too limited in geographical area or species
covered to be of use in field identification, and because conventional scientific or taxonomic groupings of the
animals are often not helpful in field identification, the photographic field guide took a different approach.
Instead of being placed into their scientific groups, species were grouped together on the basis of similarities in
appearance during the brief encounters typical at sea. Photographs of the animals in their natural
environment, supplemented by drawings and descriptions or tables distinguishing the most similar species,
formed the core of the guide.</p>

<p>Despite deficiencies in the first effort and the inherent difficulties of positively identifying many of the
cetacean species at sea, the results obtained from the programs have been encouraging. Many seafarers who
had previously looked with disinterest or ignorance on the animals they encountered became good critical
observers and found pleasure in the contribution they were making. The potential for the expansion of such
observer programs is enormous.</p>

<p>Because of these initial successes and the large number of requests for packets from persons working at
sea off the Atlantic coast of North America, this guide was planned. Many of the errors and deficiencies of the
Pacific Guide have been corrected, and the discussions of the ranges of many of the species have been expanded
with considerations of the major oceanographic factors affecting their distribution and movements. While the
present volume, like the Pacific Guide, is intended as an aid to the identification of living animals at sea, new
materials have been provided to aid in the identification and reporting of stranded specimens, a major source of
data and study material for museums. This new dimension is expected to assist the U.S. National Museum,
various regional museums, and other researchers actively collecting cetacean materials for display and study
in the implementation of their stranded animal salvage programs. Through a cooperative effort of this kind, the
best possible use can be made of all materials that become available.</p>

<p>As a part of continuing research, this guide will be revised whenever possible. Suggestions for its
improvement will at all times be welcome.</p>

<p>Funds for the preparation of this guide were provided by a grant to Stephen Leatherwood from the Platforms
of Opportunity Program, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Tiburon, Calif., Paul Sund, Coordinator.</p>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

<p>This field guide is designed to permit observers to identify the cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises)
they see in the western North Atlantic, including the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the coastal
waters of the United States and Canada. The animals described are grouped not by scientific relationships but
by similarities in appearance in the field. Photographs of the animals in their natural environment are the main
aids to identification.</p>

<p>A dichotomized key is provided to aid in identification of stranded cetaceans and appendices describe how
and to whom to report data on live and dead cetaceans.</p>


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>All whales, dolphins, and porpoises belong to an order or
major scientific group called the Cetacea by scientists. They
are all mammals (air-breathing animals which have hair in at
least some stage of their development, maintain a constant
body temperature, bear their young alive, and nurse them for
a while) which have undergone extensive changes in body
form (anatomy) and function (physiology) to cope with a life
spent entirely in the water. The breathing aperture(s), called
a blowhole or blowholes, has (have) migrated to the top of the
head to facilitate breathing while swimming; the forward
appendages have become flippers; the hind appendages have
nearly disappeared, they remain only as small traces of bone
deeply imbedded in the muscles. Propulsion is provided by
fibrous, horizontally flattened tail flukes.</p>

<p>Scientists recognize two suborders of living cetaceans: the
whalebone whales, suborder Mysticeti, and the toothed
whales, suborder Odontoceti. The two groups are separated
in the following ways:</p>

<p>BALEEN OR WHALEBONE WHALES. These animals are
called whalebone whales because when fully formed instead
of teeth they have up to 800 or more plates of baleen or
whalebone depending from the roof of the mouth. They use
these plates to strain their food, which consists of "krill"
(primarily small crustaceans) and/or small schooling fish, by
taking water into the mouth and forcing it out through the
overlapping fringes of the baleen plates. Baleen whales are
externally distinguishable from toothed whales by having
paired blowholes. There are eight species of baleen whales in
the western North Atlantic, ranging in size from the minke
whale (just over 30 feet [about 9.1 m])<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to the blue whale (85
feet [25.9 m]).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Throughout this guide, measurements are given first in feet or
inches, followed in parentheses by their equivalents in meters or
centimeters. It is recognized that field estimates cannot be as precise as
most of the conversions used.</p></div>

<p>TOOTHED WHALES. Unlike the baleen whales, the toothed
whales do have teeth after birth. The teeth vary in number
from 2 to over 250, though they may sometimes be concealed
beneath the gum. In addition, toothed whales have only a
single blowhole. This group includes the animals commonly
called dolphin or porpoise as well as some commonly called
whales (for example, the sperm whale). There are currently
about 30 species of toothed whales known from the western
North Atlantic, ranging in maximum adult size from the
common or harbor porpoise, which is approximately 5 feet
(1.5 m) long, up to the sperm whale which reaches a length of
68 feet (20.7 m). Several other species which are expected to
be found in this region, though they have not yet been
reported, are also included in this guide.</p>


<h2>CLASSIFICATION OF CETACEANS</h2>

<p>In addition to the two suborders (Mysticeti and
Odontoceti), the cetacean order contains numerous families,
genera, and species. Each of these groupings represents a
progressively more specialized division of the animals into
categories on the basis of similarities in their skulls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
postcranial skeletons, and external characteristics. The
discipline which concerns itself with naming an animal and
assigning it to its appropriate scientific category is known as
taxonomy. An example of the classification of a cetacean
species is shown in the following:</p>

<p>Modern taxonomy had its origin with the Swedish
naturalist Linnaeus, whose tenth edition of the <i>Systema
Naturae</i> in 1758 forms the official starting point. Following
Linnaeus, modern scientific names consist of two words, a
generic name, which has an initial capital, and a species name,
which rarely does, occasionally in botany (some species
names deriving from a person's name are capitalized). Both
names are usually of Latin origin (sometimes Greek) and are
italicized or underlined. These scientific names are of
particular importance because, although common names of
species often are different in different countries or even in
different regions of the same country, the scientific name
remains the same. For example, the right whale is universally
known as <i>Eubalaena glacialis</i> though its common
names include black right whale, nordcaper, sletbag, Biscay
whale, and Biscayan right whale.</p>

<p>Although classification of many species is still in a state of
flux, the classification of western North Atlantic cetaceans
followed in this guide is as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>This tentative classification follows an unpublished list by
W.E. Schevill and E.M. Mitchell currently under review. The
scientific names are followed by the name of the individual
who named the species and the year of naming, and then by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the common name most often used in the western North
Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It may be noted that some of the authors are in
parentheses. This indicates that though the species name has
remained the same since the date of naming the species has
since been assigned to another genus. Because the species are
not arranged in taxonomic order in this field guide, the page

<h2>DOLPHIN OR PORPOISE</h2>

<p>There is still considerable controversy over the correct
usage of the terms dolphin and porpoise. As mentioned in the
preceding section, common names of any species may vary
from locale to locale and even from individual to individual.
Some persons argue for the use of the term porpoise for all
small cetaceans. Others insist on the term dolphin. Still
others either randomly use the terms or call members of the
family Delphinidae dolphins and members of the family
Phocoenidae porpoises. The evidence supporting any one of
these positions is confusing at best and no usage of terms
appears to be without problems. We see no wholly
satisfactory resolution to the problem at this time. For all
these reasons, we have little desire to defend our decision to
follow the last of these practices in this guide, referring to all
members of the family Delphinidae for which the term
dolphin or porpoise appears in the common name as dolphins,
and to the one member of the family Phocoenidae represented
in the western North Atlantic, <i>Phocoena phocoena</i>, as the
harbor porpoise. Although all cetaceans may be regarded as
whales, the term "whale" most commonly applies to the
larger animals. For all species treated, other common names
by which they may be known are also listed.</p>

<p>Detailed treatment of the relative merits of the various
terminologies is inappropriate here. Furthermore, it is our
opinion that the usage of the terms dolphin, porpoise, and
whale as part of the common names of cetaceans is largely a
matter of personal preference.</p>


<h2>ORGANIZATION OF THE GUIDE</h2>

<p>The differences between baleen and toothed whales are
easy enough to see in animals washed up on the beach or
maintained in a tank at a zoo or aquarium. But since an animal
at sea can seldom be examined that closely, its most obvious
characteristics may be its overall size, the presence or
absence of a dorsal fin, its prominent coloration or markings,
its general behavior, or its swimming, blowing, and diving
characteristics. For that reason, regardless of their scientific
relationships, all the whales, dolphins, and the one porpoise
covered in the main text of this guide are divided into three
groups. Those over 40 feet (12.2 m) long are discussed in the
section on <a href="#Page_19">Large Whales</a>, those from 13 to 40 feet (4.0 to 12.2
m) in the <a href="#Page_63">Medium-Sized Whale</a>, and those less than 13 feet
(4.0 m) in the <a href="#Small_Whales_Dolphins_and_Porpoises_With_a_Dorsal_Fin">Small Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoise (with a
dorsal fin)</a>. There are no small whales, dolphins, or porpoises
in this region without a dorsal fin. Each section is
further divided into those animals with a dorsal fin and those
without. From that point, animals likely to be confused in
the field are grouped together and the important differences
between them are discussed.</p>

<p>The synoptic accounts of the species are followed by five
appendices: <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a> discusses and illustrates man-made
and applied tags and natural markings on cetaceans and their
importance in studies of natural history. <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B</a>
discusses the data which are most important to record in
observations of cetaceans at sea, gives examples, and
provides blank sighting forms. <a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a> discusses possible
causes of cetacean strandings and the manner in which
stranded animals should be handled and adds a key and tables
to aid in identifying stranded cetaceans. <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D</a>
provides guidelines for collecting data on stranded cetaceans
and provides forms and specific instructions for taking
standard measurements. <a href="#APPENDIX_E">Appendix E</a> lists institutions to be
contacted in the event of a cetacean stranding or for
information.</p>

<h2>HOW TO USE THE GUIDE</h2>


<h3>To Identify Animals at Sea</h3>

<p>The three major sections of the guide (i.e., large, medium,
and small whales) are preceded by a directory to species
accounts, which is a summary of the most obvious
characteristics of each species and in which summary
statements about each characteristic are arranged in parallel
order. To use the guide to identify living animals observed at
sea, a person or persons should:</p>


<ul>
<li>1. First estimate the animal's size and determine whether
or not it has a dorsal fin.</li>

<li>2. Note also any distinctive features of body shape and
coloration and observe its general behavior, including
swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics. It should be
noted that coloration may vary somewhat at sea, depending
on light conditions and water clarity. For example, animals
which appear dark gray or black at the surface or when dead
may appear brown in good light or when submerged. Making
a brief sketch at this point may aid in identifying the animal or
in later recalling its distinctive features.</li>

<li>3. Using the <a href="#DIRECTORY_TO_SPECIES_ACCOUNTS">directory</a>, locate the section to which the
animal probably belongs.</li>

<li>4. Then, for more detailed information, consult the section
indicated. There you will find a more complete discussion of
the animal's range, size, and distinctive characteristics. In
addition, you will find a brief discussion distinguishing it from
animals with which it is likely to be confused in the field.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>This guide will probably work best if, in advance of
attempting to use the key in the field, the reader will
familiarize himself with the general outline, with characters
or behaviors to note, and with the locations of the various
species accounts. It will also help if he schools himself to ask a
series of questions about the animal(s) he sees at the time of
the encounter rather than depending on his recall at a later
time (see p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>). As we have emphasized several times in
this guide, positive identification of cetaceans at sea can
only occasionally be made on the basis of a single characteristic.
Therefore, the greater the amount of pertinent evidence
an observer obtains, the greater the likelihood he can
make a reliable identification.</p>


<h3>To Identify Stranded Animals</h3>

<p>Stranded animals can best be identified by referring to
<a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a> and its associated tables, making a preliminary
determination and then consulting the species accounts in the
main body of the book for verification of the identification. As
noted in that appendix, if the animal is recently stranded,
identification can be made using any of the externally visible
characteristics described for the living species at sea. But
even if the animal is in an advanced stage of decomposition, it
can usually be identified by referring to the key and to the
numbers and descriptions of baleen plates, for all baleen
whales, and the numbers and relative lengths of ventral
grooves, for all balaenopterine whales (<a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a>), or to the
tables on the numbers and descriptions of teeth, for toothed
whales (<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>).</p>


<h3>To Record and Report Information</h3>

<p>As discussed in the preface, though learning to identify
the whales, dolphins, and porpoises one sees may be exciting
in itself, many persons may want to participate in the
accumulation of data on these interesting animals by
routinely reporting their observations to scientists who are
actively studying them and who can make immediate use of
the information. The following may help these persons:</p>


<p>Suggestions for making and recording observations of
cetaceans at sea and sample data forms are included in
<a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a>. Similar suggestions for taking and recording
data on stranded cetaceans are included in <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D</a>. For
both types of data, blank data forms located after the
appendices may be photocopied in bulk for use in the field.</p>

<p>Completed data forms and all associated information for
sightings at sea should be forwarded to the Platforms of
Opportunity Program, National Marine Fisheries Service,
Tiburon, CA 94920, or to one of the authors of this guide.
From there, they will be made available to scientists actively
studying the cetaceans of a given species or geographical
area.</p>

<p>Completed data forms and all associated information for
observations of stranded cetaceans should be forwarded to
the Division of Mammals, U.S. National Museum,
Washington, DC 20560, to one of the authors of this guide,
or to one of the regional laboratories listed in <a href="#APPENDIX_E">Appendix E</a>.
These persons have, in turn, been encouraged to keep a free
flow of information among them.</p>

<h3>LARGE WHALES
<br />
(40-85 feet [12-26 m] maximum overall length)</h3>


<h4>With a Dorsal Fin</h4>

<p>All five species of large whales with a dorsal fin belong to
the same major baleen whale group, the balaenopterid
whales or rorquals. All are characterized by the presence of a
series of ventral grooves, usually visible on stranded
specimens and the length and number of which are diagnostic
to species. In addition, all species, with the exception of the
humpback whale, have at least one distinctive (though often
not prominent) ridge along the head from just in front of the
blowhole to near the tip of the snout. (The humpback whale,
on the other hand, is distinguished by numerous knobs,
some of which are located along the line of the head ridge,
with others scattered on the top of the head.) In Bryde's
whale, the single head ridge characteristic of the other rorquals
is supplemented by two auxiliary ridges, one on each
side of the main ridge.</p>

<p>At sea, these whales often appear very similar and must
be examined carefully before they can be reliably identified.</p>

<p>In general, though the characteristics of behavior may
vary from one encounter to the next, based on the activities in
which the animal is engaged, whales in this group may be
distinguished from each other on the basis of differences in 1)
the size, shape, and position of the dorsal fin and the timing of
its appearance on the surface relative to the animal's blow (in
general, the larger the whale, the smaller the dorsal fin&mdash;the
further back its position and the later its appearance on the
surface after the animal's blow); 2) the height of body in the
area of the dorsal fin, relative to the size of the dorsal fin,
which is exposed as the animal sounds; 3) sometimes the blow
rate and movement patterns; and 4) the shape and color of the
head.</p>

<p>Despite variability in behavior by members of the same
species from one encounter to the next, an observer can
greatly increase the reliability of his identification by forming
the habit of working systematically through a set of
characteristics for the species rather than depending on any
single characteristic.</p>

the minke whale, is included with the medium-sized whales in this guide. Features by which it may be
distinguished from all other rorquals are discussed in the species account.</p>

<p>Further, inasmuch as the dorsal fin of the humpback whale is highly variable in shape, positive identification
may require reference to the sperm whale (p. <a href="#Page_57">57</a>), which, though the sperm whale has been classified with
species without dorsal fin, has a rather distinct dorsal hump, particularly noticeable when the animal arches
the back and tail to begin a long dive.</p>

<h3>(40-65 feet [12-20 m] maximum overall length)</h3>


<h4>Without a Dorsal Fin</h4>

<p>There are three species of large whales without a dorsal
fin in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Two of these, the
bowhead or Greenland whale, and its more widely distributed
close relative the right whale, are baleen whales. The third,
the sperm whale, is a toothed whale. The first two have
relatively smooth backs without even a trace of a dorsal fin.
The sperm whale has a humplike low, thick, dorsal ridge,
which, from certain views, particularly when the animal is
humping up to begin a dive, may be clearly visible and look
like a fin. But because the profile of that hump and the
knuckles which follow it are often not very prominent in this
species, it has been classified with the finless big whales.</p>

<p>All three species are characterized by very distinctive
blows or spouts. In both the bowhead and the right whales,
the projection of the blow upward from two widely separated
blowholes assumes a very wide V-shape with two distinct
columns, which may be seen when the animals are viewed
from front or back. Though this character may be visible
under ideal conditions in many of the other baleen whales
species as well, it is exaggerated and uniformly distinct in the
bowhead and right whales and may be used as one of the
primary key characters. In the sperm whale, the blow
emanates from a blowhole which is displaced to the left of the
head near the front and projects obliquely forward to the
animal's left. This blow seen under ideal conditions positively
labels a large whale as a sperm whale.</p>

<p>Remember, however, that wind conditions may affect the
disposition and duration of the blow of any species and that a
single character alone is seldom sufficient to permit positive
identification.</p>

<h3>MEDIUM-SIZED WHALES
<br />
(13-32 feet [4-10 m] maximum overall length)</h3>


<h4>With a Dorsal Fin</h4>

<p>There are 11 species of medium-sized whales with a dorsal
fin known from the western North Atlantic. These species,
taking many diverse forms, range in maximum adult size
from about 13 feet (4.0 m) (grampus) to about 33 feet (10.1 m)
(the minke whale). This group includes such widely
distributed and frequently encountered species as the pilot
whales, false killer whales, and minke whales, and such
rarely encountered and poorly known species as the various
"beaked whales" (<i>Mesoplodon</i> spp. and the goosebeaked
whale).</p>

<p>Aside from their common inclusion within the stated size
range and the presence of a dorsal fin in all species (which
ranges from only a small nubbin in some of the beaked whales
to a substantial 5- to 6-foot [1.5- to 1.8-m] sail on adult male
killer whales), these species have no diagnostic field
characteristics in common. Therefore, each is discussed in
detail and is placed in the text in near proximity to those
species with which it is likely to be confused in the field.</p>

or a toothed (T) whale.</p></div>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Sulphur-bottom.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Blue whales are the largest living mammals. Though
reports of maximum length and weight vary from one account
to another, Antarctic blue whales are known to have reached
lengths to 100 feet (30.5 m) and weights of over 150 tons
(136,363 kg)<a name="FNanchor_10_13" id="FNanchor_10_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_13" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> before stocks were severely depleted by
whaling operations. North Atlantic blue whales may be
expected to reach lengths of 80-85 feet (24.4-25.9 m). In all
known populations of blue whales, females are slightly larger
than males of the same age.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_13" id="Footnote_10_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_13"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The largest measured specimen was "just over" 100 feet (30.5 m); the
largest specimen weighed, the 150-ton individual noted above, was 89 feet
(27.1 m) long.</p></div>

<p>Viewed from above, the blue whale's rostrum is broad,
flat, and nearly U-shaped (actually shaped like a Gothic arch,
slightly flattened on the tip), with a single ridge extending
from the raised area just in front of the blowholes towards but
not quite reaching the tip of the snout.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is extremely small [to only 13 inches (33
cm)] and variable in shape from nearly triangular to
moderately falcate. In all cases, it is located so far back on the
animal's tail stock that it is seldom visible until the animal is
about to begin a dive.</p>

<p>Blue whales are light bluish gray overall, mottled with
gray or grayish white. Some animals may have yellowish or
mustard coloration, primarily on the belly, the result of the
accumulation of diatoms during long stays in the cooler
waters to the north. The undersides of the flippers are light
grayish blue to white.</p>

<p>The baleen plates are all black.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>The blow or "spout" is tall, to perhaps 30 feet (9.1 m),
slender, vertical, and not bushy, as is the blow of humpback
whales, for instance.</p>

<p>Although the blowing and diving patterns of blue whales
may vary, depending on the speed of movement and the
activity of the whale when it is encountered, they may be
generally described as follows: If the animal is moving slowly,
the blowhole and part of the head may still be visible when the
dorsal fin breaks the surface, and the animal may settle
quietly into the water without exposing the last portion of the
tail stock or the tail flukes. If the animal is moving more
quickly, however, or is about to begin a long dive, the
blowhole disappears below the surface, a broad expanse of
the back is exposed and disappears, and the dorsal fin
emerges briefly just before the animal lifts its tail stock and
flukes slightly above the surface before slipping out of sight.</p>

<p>In this species it can be generally stated that the maximum
height of back in the area of the dorsal fin which is exposed
above the surface as the animal sounds is approximately four
times the height of the dorsal fin itself. The exposure of the
tail flukes is unlike that of the humpback whale (<a href="#Figure_39">Fig. 39</a>), the
right whale (<a href="#Figure_50">Fig. 50</a>), or the sperm whale (<a href="#Figure_57">Fig. 57</a>) in that
when beginning a long dive all these other species raise the
flukes high out of the water and usually descend at a steep
angle. Blue whales lift the flukes only slightly, if at all.</p>

<p>Blue whales are relatively shallow feeders, feeding as
they do almost exclusively on "krill" (small shrimplike
crustaceans), most of which are distributed in the surface
330 feet (100 m). Blue whales usually occur singly or in
pairs.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>At sea, blue whales may be confused with fin whales
(p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>) and though the two are sometimes difficult to
distinguish from a distance, the following key differences
permit identification at close range:</p>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Though blue whales have been reported from the pack ice
to Cristobal Harbor, Panama Canal Zone, their normal range
in the western North Atlantic is more limited. In spring and
summer months (about April through at least August) they
can be expected in the northern portion of their range, at
least as far north as the Arctic Circle, feeding on the krill
abundant in those waters. A small portion of the population
may venture north, beyond the Circle. In fall and winter the
population moves south, presumably into temperate and
perhaps to tropical waters. Reliable records include animals
from observations off Long Island and Ocean City, Md.</p>

<p>Though southern limits of the species are poorly known,
there are no records from Florida or the West Indies and no
verified records from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Summaries of blue whale distribution based on records
when the species was more numerous indicate that they were
found during spring and summer months in some abundance
on the Nova Scotian Banks, the St. Lawrence Gulf and
estuary, the Strait of Belle Isle, Grand Bank, and in the
waters off the coasts of Iceland, southern Greenland, and the
Davis Straits and Baffin Bay. (Some individuals have entered
the Hudson Strait but not apparently Hudson Bay itself.)</p>

<p>Historically, a few animals apparently appeared off the
coast of southeastern Canada as early as February. It was
speculated that from there a portion of the population
underwent a migration from the Strait of Belle Isle north
through the Davis Straits to the waters off western Greenland.
Some individuals entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence after
the ice was clear and remained behind until as late as November.
In the fall months, certainly by November, the northern
portion of the population had begun retreating to the south in
front of the advancing ice. The remainder apparently also
underwent this migration as well, since blue whales have
historically been nearly absent from Canadian waters during
midwinter.</p>

<p>Many of the migrating individuals were assumed to
continue south to temperate and, less frequently, to tropical
water where they calved. It should be emphasized that
though all of the southward and the subsequent northward
migrations were presumed to be along pelagic routes, details
were poorly documented.</p>

<p>Blue whales have been reported in both shallow inshore
and deep oceanic zones.</p>

<p>Despite considerable attention in the popular literature to
the plight of the blue whale populations and frequent
statements that they are near extinction, blue whale stocks in
the western North Atlantic appear more abundant than has
been usually reported. While present stocks are far short of
previous population sizes, which may have exceeded 200,000
individuals worldwide, they should be sufficiently large for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the species to continue their increase, barring renewed
exploitation.</p>



<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded blue whales can be readily identified by 1) the
large body size (to 85 feet [25.9 m]); 2) the broad flat head; 3)
the all-black baleen plates (270-395 in number), which are
usually barely more than twice as long as they are wide; and
4) the 55-88 ventral grooves extending to the navel or beyond
(<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<p>Depending on the state of decay and the position of the
stranded specimen, any of the body characteristics described
for living animals may also be used to positively identify the
specimen.</p>

<h4><a name="FIN_WHALE_B" id="FIN_WHALE_B"></a>FIN WHALE (B)
<br />
<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i> (Linnaeus 1758)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Finback whale, finner, razorback, common rorqual.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Fin whales have been reported to reach 79 feet (24 m).
Females are slightly larger than males of the same age.</p>

<p>The back is distinctly ridged towards the tail, prompting
the common name "razorback" whale.</p>

<p>The rostrum is narrower and more V-shaped than that of
the blue whale and has the same sort of single distinctive head
ridge. The top of the head is flat, though slightly less than
that of the blue whale.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is up to 24 inches (61 cm) tall; angled less
than 40&deg; on the forward margin, located slightly more than
one-third forward from the tail, and appears on the surface
shortly after the blow.</p>

<p>All individuals are dark gray to brownish black on the
back and sides with none of the mottling present on blue
whales and are rarely as heavily scarred as sei whales. Along
the back, just behind the head, there is a grayish-white
chevron, with the apex along the midline of the back and the
arms of the chevron oriented posteriorly, which is sometimes
distinctive and may be visible as the animals surface to
breathe. The undersides, including the undersides of the
flukes and flippers, are white. On the head, the dark
coloration is markedly asymmetrical, reaching farther down
on the left than on the right side. The right lower lip,
including the mouth cavity, and the right front baleen
(approximately one-fifth to one-third) are yellowish white.
Occasionally the right upper lip is also white. The remainder
of the plates on the right side and all those on the left side are
striped with alternate bands of yellowish white and bluish
gray. The fringes of the plates are brownish gray to grayish
white.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Fin whales are one of the most common baleen whale species
in the world and constitute a major portion of the whaling
catch. They are reportedly one of the fastest of the big whales
(sei whales may be slightly faster) possibly reaching burst
speeds in excess of 20 knots, and were not an important commercial
species until the comparatively recent development of
fast catcher boats and the depletion of blue whale stocks.</p>

<p>A fin whale's blow can be from 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 m)
tall and has been described as an inverted cone or an
elongated ellipse.</p>

<p>Fin whales dive to at least 755 feet (230.1 m). This depth is
probably deeper than that of either blue or sei whales, a
factor usually reflected in differences among the surfacing,
blowing, and diving characteristics of these three species.
When they are moving leisurely at the surface, fin whales
expose the dorsal fin shortly after the appearance of the
blowholes, slightly later than that of the sei whales. When
they are surfacing from a deeper dive, however, they surface
at a steeper angle, blow, submerge the blowholes, and then
arch the back and dorsal fin high into the air before beginning
another long dive. In this species it can be generally stated
that the maximum amount of the back in the area of the dorsal
fin which is exposed above the surface as the animal sounds is
approximately 2 times the height of the dorsal fin. Fin whales
do not show their tail flukes when beginning a dive.</p>

<p>Unlike blue or sei whales, fin whales do breach on
occasion. When they do leap clear of the water, fin whales
usually reenter with a resounding splash, like that made by
humpback and right whales and not smoothly, head first, as
minke whales often do.</p>

<p>Fin whales are sometimes found singly or in pairs but
more often occur in pods of six or seven individuals and many
pods consisting of as many as 50 animals may be concentrated
in a small area.</p>

<p>Fin whales calve and breed in winter, mostly in temperate
waters.</p>

<p>Atlantic fin whales eat a wide variety of foods, including
krill, capelin, squid, herring, and lanternfish.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Fin whales may be confused with blue whales, sei whales,
and, in the southernmost portion of their range, with Bryde's
whales. They may be distinguished from the blue whales by
differences in overall coloration, coloration and shape of the
head, and the size, position, and time of appearance of the
dorsal fin at the surface (see p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>). After close examination
they may be distinguished from Bryde's whales by the
presence of three ridges along the head (of the Bryde's whale)
and by the smaller, more sharply pointed falcate dorsal fin of
the Bryde's whale (see <a href="#Figure_31">Fig. 31</a>). They may be distinguished
from sei whales in the following similar ways:</p>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Fin whales are probably the most numerous and widely
distributed large whale species in the western North
Atlantic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Fin whales summer from below the latitude of Cape Cod,
Mass., north to the Arctic Circle. (They are frequently seen
between New York and Bermuda this time of year.) Within
this zone they may sometimes be seen very close to shore and
appear to be concentrated between shore and the
1,000-fathom curve from at least lat. 41&deg;20' to 57&deg;00' N. In
recent years they have been reported in relatively large
numbers in the Gulf of Maine from March through June, off
Newfoundland as early as June but increasing to August, and
entering Davis Straits and beyond in substantial numbers in
midsummer to late summer. There is some evidence that the
animals venturing farthest north are the largest individuals
of the species. Movements of the population(s) southward
have usually begun by October, though some fin whales
sometimes remain in the northern seas sufficiently long to
become trapped in the ice and killed.</p>

<p>During winter the range of fin whales spreads out from
the advancing ice southward, reaching at least to the coast of
Florida, into the Gulf of Mexico, and to the Greater Antilles,
though fin whales are not at all common in tropical waters.
During the winter many fin whales move into offshore
waters. Northward migrations probably begin in midspring.</p>

<p>Fin whales may be found in Cape Cod waters all year
long.</p>

<p>There may be two or possibly three separate stocks of fin
whales in the western North Atlantic, one more northern
cold-adapted stock and another more southern stock. The
ranges of the two stocks appear to overlap, such that the
winter range of the northern stock probably becomes the
spring and summer range of the more southern stock. The
third stock may consist of an isolated population in the
northern Gulf of Mexico.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded fin whales may be most readily identified by 1)
the yellowish-white coloration of the right front baleen and
the right white lower lip; 2) the numerous baleen plates
(262-473 in number); 3) the numerous ventral grooves (56-100
in number) extending to the navel and beyond (<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>); and
4) the broad, flat sharply pointed head with only a single head
ridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="SEI_WHALE_B" id="SEI_WHALE_B"></a>SEI WHALE (B)
<br />
<i>Balaenoptera borealis</i> Lesson 1828</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Pollack whale, sardine whale, Rudolphi's rorqual.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Sei (pronounced "say") whales have been reported to
reach 62 feet (19 m).</p>

<p>The snout is less acutely pointed than that of the fin whale
but when viewed from the side appears slightly arched. In
general, the head is intermediate in shape between that of the
blue whale and that of the fin whale. The dorsal fin, which is
from 10 to 24 inches (25.4 to 61 cm) tall and strongly falcate in
adult animals, is located about two-thirds of the way back on
the back, farther forward than that of the blue or fin whales.
Sei whales are dark steel gray on the back and sides, and on
the posterior portion of the ventral surface. The body often
has a galvanized appearance due to scars possibly resulting
from lamprey bites inflicted during migrations into warmer
waters. These scars may be dark gray to almost white in
color. On the belly there is a region of grayish white that is
confined to the area of the ventral grooves. Neither the
flippers nor the tail flukes are white underneath. The right
lower lip and the mouth cavity, unlike those of the fin whale,
are uniformly gray. The baleen plates are uniformly grayish
black with fine grayish-white fringes. (A small number of sei
whales have been noted to have a few half-white plates near
the front of the mouth, a feature which might result in their
confusion with fin whales.)</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>The blow of sei whales is an inverted cone rarely taller
than 15 feet (4.6 m).</p>

<p>Sei whales are generally skimmer feeders and do not
usually dive very deeply. For that reason they usually surface
at a shallower angle than fin whales. The head rarely
emerges at a steep angle (except when the whales are
chased). Instead, the blowholes and a major portion of the
back, including the dorsal fin, become visible almost
simultaneously and remain visible for relatively long periods
of time. In this species it can be generally stated that the
amount of the back in the area of the dorsal fin which is
exposed above the surface as the animal sounds is
approximately the same height as the dorsal fin. When they
begin another dive, sei whales do not arch the tail stock or
flukes high. Instead, they normally submerge by slipping
quietly below the surface, often remaining in view only a few
feet down and leaving a series of tracks or swirls on the
surface as they move their tail flukes. When they are feeding
in this manner, sei whales may exhibit a highly regular
blowing and diving pattern over long periods of time.</p>

<p>Sei whales usually travel in groups of from two to five
individuals, though they may concentrate in large numbers
on the feeding grounds.</p>

<p>In the northern portion of their range, sei whales feed on
copepods. Throughout the remainder of the range, however,
their food is more varied and also includes krill and a variety
of small schooling fishes. The species derived its common
name, in fact, from its frequent occurrence with or near sei
fish.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>The sei whale's smaller size and decidedly taller, more
falcate dorsal fin located well more than one-third forward
from the tail should prevent confusion with the blue whale. At
a distance, however, sei whales are difficult to distinguish
from either fin whales or Bryde's whales. The primary clues
for distinguishing them from fins are the differences in
swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics tabularized in
detail on p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a> and the asymmetrical coloration of the fin
whale.</p>

<p>Sei whales may be distinguished from Bryde's whales only
upon close examination. The dorsal fin of Bryde's whales is
small, to 18 inches (45.7 cm), sharply pointed, and often worn
on the rear margin. If close examination is possible, the sei
whale will be seen to have only a single head ridge. Bryde's
whales have two additional ridges&mdash;one on each side of the
main ridge. Bryde's whales are primarily fish feeders and
their diving behavior more closely resembles that of a fin
whale than that of a sei whale. (See p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a>).</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>The distribution and migrations of the sei whale during
most of the year are rather poorly known. The species is
known to avoid the colder regions near the pack ice and to
range from Iceland south to the northeast Venezuelan coast
and the northeast and southwest Gulf of Mexico. There are
also records from Cuba and the Virgin Islands. Along the
northeast United States and eastern Canadian coasts, where
most research on sei whales has been conducted, the species
migrates from New England through the Blanford, Nova
Scotia area in June and July, is found in small numbers off
eastern Newfoundland in August and September (abundant
in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland in August), and continues
northward to the Davis Straits in September and October.
An offshore stock may be found year-round in the Labrador
Sea. The summer range (May to September or October)
extends from New England to southern Arctic waters.
Though some individuals remain behind through November,
the southward movement of the bulk of the population
presumably begins in October. In general, sei whales do not
venture as far north as fin whales but may have a greater
tendency to enter tropical waters.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded sei whales are most likely to be confused with fin
whales or Bryde's whales. The three head ridges of the
Bryde's whale (sei whales have only one) assist in distinguishing
sei whales from Bryde's whales. They may be distinguished
from fin whales and all other rorquals by the following
characteristics: 1) The color of the baleen plates&mdash;uniformly
ash black with a blue tinge and fine white bristles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
(<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>). 2) The density of bristles on the plates&mdash;sei whales
have from 35 to 60 baleen fringes per centimeter; all other
rorquals have far fewer (less than 35). 3) The relative lengths
of the ventral grooves&mdash;the grooves of sei whales end well
before the navel; those of blue, fin, and Bryde's whales
extend at least to the navel. 4) The relatively small numbers
of ventral grooves (38-56)&mdash;both blue and fin whales have
more; Bryde's whales have approximately the same number.</p>

<p>If the animal is not in an advanced state of decomposition,
the region of white coloration of the belly may also be visible.</p>

<h4><a name="BRYDES_WHALE_B" id="BRYDES_WHALE_B"></a>BRYDE'S WHALE (B)
<br />
<i>Balaenoptera edeni</i> Anderson 1879</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>None known.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Bryde's whales reach a maximum length of approximately
46 feet (14 m). They closely resemble sei whales in external
appearance. At a distance, the head of this species is similar
in profile and general appearance to that of the sei whale. The
most distinctive field characteristic of the species, however,
is the presence of three ridges along the head anterior to the
blowhole. In addition to the medial ridge characteristic of all
the other balaenopterid species, Bryde's whales have two
secondary ridges on the top of the head&mdash;one along each side
even with the blowhole running forward towards the tip of
the snout. If they can be examined at close range, Bryde's
whales can be positively identified by this character alone.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin of Bryde's whales is up to 18 inches (45.7 cm)
tall, extremely falcate, pointed on the tip, located well more
than one-third forward from the tail, and is often irregularly
notched or frayed on the rear margin from unknown causes.
Bryde's whales are dark gray overall, though some
individuals, like some minke whales, have a small region of
gray on each side just forward of the dorsal fin.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Bryde's whales, like minke whales, reportedly often
approach close to vessels as if curious about them. During this
time they may be examined carefully and their identifying
characteristics seen.</p>

<p>Though euphausiids may be an important food for this
species in limited areas, Bryde's whales often feed on
schooling fish (including pilchards, anchovies, herring, and
mackerel). This food preference is reflected in the diving
behavior of the species. Bryde's whales are not "skimmer"
feeders; they are deeper divers. When they surface to
breathe, they often rise more steeply to the surface, exposing
much of the head, roll the body sharply, and hump up the tail
stock before beginning another dive. In this species, as in the
fin whale, it can be generally stated that the amount of the
back which is exposed above the surface as the animal sounds
is approximately twice the height of the dorsal fin. They
apparently do not raise the tail flukes when beginning a dive.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>At sea Bryde's whales may be confused with sei whales,
fin whales, and perhaps minke whales.</p>

<p>They may be most readily distinguished from sei whales
by the characteristics discussed on p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a> and by differences in
diving behavior. The shallow-feeding sei whales surface and
blow at regular intervals over long periods of time. Bryde's
whales are deeper divers, less likely to surface, and blow at
evenly spaced intervals. If they are seen only briefly or at a
distance, however, the two species may be impossible to
differentiate.</p>

<p>During the winter months, when fin whales may venture
into tropical waters, they may also be confused with Bryde's
whales. But fin whales seldom exhibit curiosity about boats.
In addition, the dorsal fin of the fin whale is larger, is located
farther back on the back than that of Bryde's whale, and does
not become visible as soon after the blow. It is also less likely
to be worn on the rear margin than that of a Bryde's whale.</p>

<p>The head of the fin whale is more acutely pointed.
Furthermore, the right lower lip and the right front baleen of
the fin whale are white. The baleen and the right lower lip of
Bryde's whales are dark gray. If the animals can be
approached closely from the right side, positive identification
is possible using these differences in color.</p>

<p>Like Bryde's whales, minke whales often approach close
to vessels. But minke whales have an acutely pointed snout, a
single head ridge, and a white band on each flipper. Further,
minke whales rarely reach 30 feet (9.1 m) in maximum length.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>The distribution of Bryde's whales is rather poorly
known, no doubt in part, because the species is difficult to
positively identify at sea, and records of its occurrence may
have often been confused with those of sei whales, fin whales,
or minke whales. From stranded animals and confirmed
sightings at sea, the species appears to be found primarily
near shore in areas of high productivity in tropical or
subtropical waters, though it ventures into warmer
temperate waters as well. It has been reported from Virginia
south into the northeast Gulf of Mexico and the southeast
Caribbean, and southern West Indies (Curacao and Granada).
To date no migration has been described for the species.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded Bryde's whales can be positively identified by
the three ridges along the top of the head from the area of the
blowhole to the tip of the snout. All other species of
balaenopterid whales, except humpback whales have but a
single ridge. If the head of a stranded specimen is buried in
sand, is decomposed beyond recognition, or is otherwise
inaccessible for identification, Bryde's whales can still be
distinguished from sei whales by differences in the relative
lengths of the ventral grooves (<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>) and from both the fin
whale and the sei whale by differences in the characteristics
of the baleen plates (<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<h4><a name="HUMPBACK_WHALE_B" id="HUMPBACK_WHALE_B"></a>HUMPBACK WHALE (B)
<br />
<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i> (Borowski 1781)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Humpbacked whale, bunch, hump whale, or hunchbacked
whale.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Humpback whales reach a length of 53 feet (16.2 m).</p>

<p>The body is robust, narrowing rapidly on the tail stock.
The head is quite broad and rounded, somewhat like that of
the blue whale. The head ridge characteristic of other
balaenopterid species is indistinct and is replaced in
prominence by a string of fleshy "knobs" or protuberances,
many more of which are randomly distributed on the top of
the head and on the lower jaw. There is a distinctive rounded
projection near the tip of the lower jaw. Humpback whales
carry many barnacles and whale lice. The baleen plates are all
black with black or olive-black bristles.</p>

<p>The flippers are very long (nearly a third as long as the
body), are scalloped on at least the leading edge, and are
nearly all white.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin, located slightly more than two-thirds of the
way back on the back in approximately the same position as
that of the fin whale, is small and varies in size and shape from
a small, triangular nubbin to a more substantial, sharply
falcate fin. The dorsal fin frequently includes a step or hump,
which is quite distinct when the animal arches its back to
begin a dive and from which the species derives its common
name.</p>

<p>Humpback whales are basically black in color with a white
region of varying size on the belly, which upon close
examination may often be seen to be crosshatched with thin
dark lines; the flippers and the undersides of the flukes also
are white.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>The blow of humpback whales is from 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to
3.1 m) tall and has been described as balloon-shaped. It is
wide relative to its height. Feeding humpback whales
habitually blow 4-8 times at intervals of 15-30 s after a long
dive. In the tropics they habitually blow 2-4 times in
succession when beginning a long dive. In diving, humpback
whales throw the tail flukes high into the air, exposing the
sometimes white undersurface and the rippled rear margin.</p>

<p>Humpback whales often leap clear of the water, raise a
flipper, and slap it against the water, or "lobtail," raising the
tail high into the air and bringing it crashing back to the water
in a loud report. Often, particularly when they are
encountered on their tropical breeding grounds, humpback
whales will be found lying on their sides with a long flipper in
the air.</p>

<p>Humpback whales feed on krill and schooling fish.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>From a distance humpback whales may be confused with
any of the other large balaenopterid (rorqual) whales&mdash;blue,
fin, sei, or Bryde's. Although it is highly variable, the dorsal
fin most closely resembles that of the blue whale. However, it
is located farther forward on the back. Humpback whales
distinguish themselves from the remainder of the rorquals by
their habit of raising the flukes high into the air when starting
a long dive. (In very shallow water they may not raise the
flukes at all.) The only other rorqual to do so&mdash;the blue
whale&mdash;raises the flukes slightly or not at all.</p>

<p>Under some conditions humpback whales may be
confused with sperm whales at a distance. When arching the
back to begin a dive, both may show a distinct hump. Both
species frequently raise their flukes nearly vertically when
beginning a long dive but differ in several ways. The flukes of
humpback whales show varying amounts of white beneath,
are pointed on the tips, and are distinctly concaved and
irregularly rippled on the rear margin. Those of sperm
whales are all dark and more flattened and even along the
rear margin. Further the species can be distinguished in the
following ways:</p>

</table>

<p>When they can be examined at close range, humpback
whales can be easily distinguished from all other large whale
species with a dorsal fin by the tuberosities or knobs on the
head, by the long white flippers scalloped on the leading edge,
by the small distinctive dorsal fin, and by their distinctive tail
flukes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>In the western North Atlantic, humpback whales are
widely distributed from north of Iceland, Disko Bay and west
of Greenland, south to Venezuela and around the tropical
islands of the West Indies. They have been reported from the
central and eastern Gulf of Mexico. Summer ranges extend at
least from New England north to the pack ice, and feeding
concentrations may be found in any portion of this region.
During winter, humpback whales migrate southward to the
shallow borderlands of Bermuda, to the Bahamas, and to the
West Indies to calve and mate.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>The most distinctive features of stranded humpback
whales are 1) the ventral grooves, 14-22 in number, very wide
and extending to the navel; 2) the tuberosities of the snout
and lower jaw, often the sites of numerous barnacle colonies;
3) the long flippers (to nearly a third of the total body length);
and 4) the distinctive rounded projection near the tip of the
lower jaw.</p>

<p>If these characteristics are not sufficiently clear, the
species may be identifiable by the characteristics of the
baleen plates (<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<h4><a name="BOWHEAD_WHALE_B" id="BOWHEAD_WHALE_B"></a>BOWHEAD WHALE (B)
<br />
<i>Balaena mysticetus</i> Linnaeus 1758</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Greenland whale, Arctic right whale, great polar whale.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Bowhead whales, so-called because of the high-arching
jaws and the resultant contour of the head, reach a maximum
length of about 65 feet (19.8 m). They are extremely robust in
form.</p>

<p>When viewed from the side, some swimming bowhead
whales show two characteristic curves to the back: the first
extends from the tip of the snout to just behind the blowholes;
the second, encompassing the entire back, begins just behind
the head and extends all the way to the tail. This character
may be present only in adult animals and may be more
pronounced in males. Younger animals, particularly females,
are often stubbier and somewhat barrel-shaped behind the
head. In all animals the back is smooth, lacking even a trace of
a dorsal fin.</p>

<p>The head of the bowhead whale is smooth, black, and
without the bonnet and the "rock-garden," the colorful
clusters of callosities characteristic of the black right whale.
The blowholes are widely separated, and the blow emanating
from them projects upward as two separate, distinct spouts.
Though two separate columns sometimes may be visible
under windless conditions in the blows of most mysticetes,
this feature is exaggerated and is most characteristic in the
bowhead and right whales.</p>

<p>Bowhead whales are black overall, except for a white
"vest" of uneven coloration on the chin. Within that vest, near
the sides of the white zone, there may be a series of grayish
black to black spots, which on some animals have been likened
to a string of beads. The vest is clearly visible when a
surfacing animal is viewed from the front or the side or when
the animals hang vertically in the water with the head on the
surface and the tail flukes down, as they do during periods of
early spring mating.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Bowhead whales are usually found singly or in groups of
up to three animals, though fall concentrations may include
up to 50 animals.</p>

<p>Bowhead whales sometimes breach, throwing most of the
body clear of the surface and reentering with a resounding
splash.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Bowhead whales are the only species of large whales
found routinely in Arctic waters. Though other species,
including some of the balaenopterid whales and the right
whale, may venture north as far as the southern limits of the
bowhead whale and beyond, they usually do so in the spring
and summer, at a time when the bowhead whales are farther
to the north. Even if they are encountered together, bowhead
whales can be distinguished from all the balaenopterid whales
by the absence of a dorsal fin. Bowhead whales have neither a
fin nor the slightest trace of a dorsal fin or ridge, while all the
balaenopterids have a dorsal fin; and their back is extremely
smooth, like that of the right whale. The bowhead and right
whales may be readily distinguished from one another by the
characters listed below for stranded specimens.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Though bowhead whales in the western North Atlantic
were once distributed from Arctic waters, from the edge of
the ice, south as far as the Strait of Belle Isle and the St.
Lawrence River in such abundance that they were once
referred to simply as "the whale," overwhaling through the
19th century until as recently as 1911 has severely reduced
their numbers and restricted their modern range. Today in
addition to the more abundant populations of the Bering,
Beaufort, and Chukchi seas and the Sea of Okhotsk, there are
populations off eastern Greenland and in Davis Straits, Baffin
Bay, James Bay, and the adjacent waters. Within these
ranges, bowhead whales move southward in front of the
advancing ice floes and may be expected near the southern
limits of their range from September or October through the
early spring months. Populations in the western North
Atlantic appear to be increasing slowly.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>In addition to the fact that their ranges may overlap only
slightly if at all, bowhead whales may be distinguished from
the other right whales of the western North Atlantic by
differences in 1) primary distribution, 2) coloration, 3)
lengths of the longest baleen plates, and 4) presence of
callosities.</p>

<h4><a name="RIGHT_WHALE_B" id="RIGHT_WHALE_B"></a>RIGHT WHALE (B)
<br />
<i>Eubalaena glacialis</i> (Borowski 1781)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Black right whale, Biscayan right whale, Biscay whale,
Nordcaper right whale.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>These right whales reach a length of about 53 feet (16.2
m).</p>

<p>The body is rotund and completely lacking a dorsal fin or a
dorsal ridge. The upper jaw is long, narrow, and highly
arched. The lips are similarly highly arched. The top of the
head has a series of bumps or callosities, the largest one of
which is known as the "bonnet," on the upper surface in front
of the blowholes. Yellowish-brown lice and, less frequently,
barnacles grow on the callosities. The color and extent of the
callosities varies from one individual to the next.</p>

<p>The two blowholes are widely separated, resulting in the
projection of the blow upward as two distinct spouts. The
body is dark on the back, sometimes black, more often brown
or mottled, usually has a region of white on the chin and belly,
and sometimes has numerous small grayish-white scars of
unknown origin. The baleen plates are up to 7.2 feet (2.2 m)
long, very narrow, and variable in color from dark brownish
through dark gray to black in color. When the animals swim,
mouth agape near the surface, the baleen sometimes
appears pale yellowish gray in color.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Right whales are usually not wary of boats and may often
be approached very closely.</p>

<p>Like sperm and humpback whales, they usually throw
their flukes high into the air when beginning a long dive.</p>

<p>Right whales feed primarily on copepods.</p>

<p>Historically, this whale was nearly exterminated by
hunters, who took advantage of its slow speed and who knew
that its carcass floats, to harvest these animals for their great
yield of whalebone and oil. It was these characteristics which
prompted whalers to dub these animals the "right" whales to
kill (as opposed to the ones that were too fast to catch and
sank when killed).</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>The distinct blow of the right whales and their smooth
dark back, devoid of any traces of a dorsal fin, make it
unlikely that the species will be confused with any other large
whales except, perhaps, the bowhead whale. In the event
that the expansion of their ranges again causes these two
species to overlap in distribution, they can be distinguished
from one another by the characteristics discussed on p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>.</p>

<p>If only the flukes are seen as the animal begins a dive,
right and bowhead whales may be distinguished from the
other two species of large whales exhibiting this behavior,
the sperm and the humpback, in this way: the flukes of right
and bowhead whales are broad, pointed on the tips, greatly
concave towards a deep fluke notch, and dark below:
those of the sperm whale are more nearly triangular, while
those of the humpback whale have a jagged irregular or
rippled rear margin and are sometimes variously white
below.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Like its more northern relative, the bowhead whale, the
right whale was once the object of a widespread and
extensive whale fishery, which reduced the species to
critically low numbers.</p>

<p>Though the former range of right whales is not clearly
known, the species is thought to have been abundant from the
Davis Straits south at least to the Carolinas and Bermuda and
to have occurred in winter to Florida and perhaps into the
Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Currently, right whales are known from Iceland south to
Florida. Animals move north along the eastern Florida coast
between early January and late March. During this time the
species has also been observed in the Gulf of Mexico off
southwestern Florida and Texas. Right whales pass the coast
of New England in fair numbers in spring and continue as far
north as at least Nova Scotia. Right whales are also found off
Iceland, though the migration routes to and from Iceland
waters are not known. The recent apparent increases in
numbers at the northern and southern coastal approaches in
New England and Florida, respectively, lend credibility to
the hopeful contention that the species will again recolonize
its historical range.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded right whales can be easily identified by all the
characters discussed on p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a> and summarized in <a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="SPERM_WHALE_T" id="SPERM_WHALE_T"></a>SPERM WHALE (T)
<br />
<i>Physeter catodon</i> Linnaeus 1758</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Cachalot, Sea Wap (St. Vincent).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Male sperm whales have been reported to reach a length
of 69 feet (20.9 m), though today individuals larger than 50
feet (15.2 m) are rare. Females are much smaller, rarely
exceeding 38 feet (11.6 m).</p>

<p>A sperm whale is among the easiest of whales to identify
at sea even when comparatively little of the animal is visible.
It has a huge head, which comprises from a fourth to a third of
the animal's total length. (The proportion is considerably
higher for males than for females.) The blunted "squarish"
snout, which may project up to 5 feet (1.5 m) beyond the tip of
the lower jaw, houses a large reservoir containing a high-quality
oil called spermaceti.</p>

<p>The single blowhole is located well to the left of the
midline and far forward on the head. As a consequence the
small bushy blow, usually less than 8 feet (2.4 m), emerges
forward at a sharp angle from the head and towards the left.
Under good wind conditions this feature alone may permit
positive identification of sperm whales even at considerable
distances.</p>

<p>Sperm whales have a distinct dorsal hump, usually
rounded in its appearance about two-thirds of the way back
from the tip of the snout. Immediately behind the hump is a
series of knuckles or crenulations along the midline. This
hump and the crenulations are clearly visible when the
animals arch the tail before beginning a dive. There is a
ventral keel, which may also be visible as animals "sound"
(dive). The flukes of sperm whales are broad and triangular in
shape, are not concaved, but are deeply notched on the rear
margin.</p>

<p>Sperm whales usually are dark brownish gray in color.
The body has a "corrugated" or "shriveled" appearance. The
belly and the front of the head may be grayish to off-white.
The skin around the mouth, particularly near the corners, is
white. The undersides of the flukes and flippers vary in color
through numerous shades of browns and brownish grays.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Sperm whales may dive to depths in excess of 3,270 feet
(996.7 m) for periods of an hour or more. As do most whales
upon surfacing from a deep dive, sperm whales emit a single
explosive blow and then, depending on the length of the dive,
may remain on the surface for over 10 min and blow more than
50 times before beginning the next dive. Shorter periods on
the surface and fewer blows are more common. Females may
dive and remain on the surface for shorter periods of time
than males. When beginning a deep dive, sperm whales
throw their broad triangular flukes, dark on the undersides,
high into the air.</p>

<p>Sperm whales may be found singly or in groups of up to 35
or 40 individuals. Older males are usually solitary except
during the breeding season. During the remainder of the year
large groups may be bachelor bulls (sexually inactive males)
or nursery schools containing females and juveniles of both
sexes. Sperm whales are seldom found in less than 600 feet
(182.9 m) of water.</p>

<p>Sperm whales feed primarily on squid but may occasionally
also take octopuses and a variety of fishes.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Because of their distinctive head shape and blow, sperm
whales are unlikely to be confused with any other species
when they can be closely examined. If only the back and tail
flukes are seen, however, sperm whales may somewhat
resemble humpback whales. Both species arch the back when
beginning a dive, raising the fin or hump, and both throw the
tail flukes. The most distinctive differences between the two
species are tabularized on p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>.</p>

<p>At sea the head of a sperm whale may also somewhat
resemble that of an adult male northern bottlenosed whale,
but this latter species is lighter brown in color, has a distinct
beak and a prominent dorsal fin, and is rarely found south of
lat. 42&deg;N. In addition, the blowhole of the northern
bottlenosed whale is located well back on the head and
not&mdash;as in the sperm whale&mdash;on the front.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Sperm whales are widely distributed in oceanic areas of
the western North Atlantic. They may be encountered from
Venezuela north at least as far as the Davis Straits, though
they apparently avoid the polar ice fields. Distribution and
migrations vary between males and females. Males range
farther to the north, while females and immature males
remain between lat. 30&deg; and 50&deg;N. Both groups shift
northward during spring and summer and return to southern
portions of their range in the fall. Adult males arrive off the
New England coast in August. Those reaching the
Newfoundland and Labrador coasts arrive from the deep sea,
perhaps following the slope contours, in August and
September. Males are abundant as far north as southeast
Greenland and Iceland in summer. Some animals remain as
late as November, but the majority migrate south to temperate
or tropical waters in the early fall.</p>

<p>Historically the primary grounds in the western North
Atlantic were those in all the following areas: the Grand
Banks just southeast of the southern Grand Banks from lat.
30&deg; to 40&deg;N and long. 35&deg; to 55&deg;W, off the Carolinas, around
the Bahamas, around many of the West Indies, and in the
southwestern Caribbean.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded sperm whales should be easy to identify. The
very narrow underslung jaw contains from 18 to 25 functional
teeth, which fit into sockets in the upper jaw. The huge,
distinctly box-shaped head and the position of the single
blowhole to the left front of the head are unmistakable clues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="MINKE_WHALE_B" id="MINKE_WHALE_B"></a>MINKE WHALE (B)
<br />
<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i> Lacepede 1804</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Little piked whale, lesser rorqual, little firmer, sharp-headed
finner, grampus (Newfoundland), gibord (Quebec).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Minke whales are the smallest baleen whale species in the
northern hemisphere, reaching maximum lengths of just over
30 feet (9.1 m). One of the most distinctive features of this
species is an extremely narrow, pointed, distinctly triangular
rostrum with a single head ridge, similar to but much sharper
than that of the fin whale (hence the common name
"sharp-headed finner"). Minke whales have a tall, falcate
dorsal fin located in the latter third of the back, in about the
same position as that of the sei whale, which often becomes
visible simultaneously with the low, usually inconspicuous
blow.</p>

<p>Minke whales are black to dark gray on the back and white
on the belly and on the underside of the flippers. Portions of
the underside of the flukes may be steel bluish gray. They
have a diagonal band of white on each flipper, the extent and
orientation of which varies individually.</p>

<p>Like the fin whale, minke whales (at least from the Pacific)
sometimes have a chevron on the back behind the head and
often have two regions of lightish-gray coloration on each
side&mdash;one just above and behind the flippers; another just in
front of and below the dorsal fin. These patches may be quite
conspicuous on some animals, indetectable on others. These
markings may also be present on Atlantic specimens, though
they have not yet been documented. The baleen, which may
be visible from close range when the animal is feeding, is
mostly yellowish white with fine white bristles. The posterior
plates (up to half) may be brown to black.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Minke whales are frequently found as single animals,
pairs, or trios, though they may congregate in areas of food
concentration in the northern seas during the spring and
summer. They are more likely to be seen up close than their
larger cousins&mdash;the blue, fin, and sei whales&mdash;because they
often closely approach boats, particularly stationary boats, as
if curious about them.</p>

<p>Minke whales may also approach very close to shore and
often enter bays, inlets, and estuaries.</p>

<p>Like fin whales, they often arch the tail stock high into the
air when beginning a long dive. However, they do not raise
the flukes above the surface when beginning a dive.</p>

<p>Minke whales feed primarily on small shoal fish (herring,
cod, pollack, and capelin).</p>

<p>Minkes sometimes breach, leaping completely clear of the
water and entering smoothly, head first, or with a substantial
splash like humpback whales.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>When they are seen at relatively close range, minke
whales can be readily distinguished from the other rorquals
that have relatively tall, falcate dorsal fins (fin, sei, and
Bryde's whales) by their considerably smaller size and by
their distinctive white band on each flipper.</p>

<p>At a distance, however, positive identification may be
difficult. Minke whales have a small, low, inconspicuous blow.
Like sei whales, they frequently expose the dorsal fin
simultaneously with the blow, but minke whales hump the
tail stock much higher when beginning a long dive&mdash;more like
fin whales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>From a distance, minke whales might also be mistaken for
northern bottlenosed whales (or any of several other beaked
whales with a similar dorsal fin). They can be distinguished
by the differences in head shape, body color and markings,
and behavior, detailed on p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Minke whales are distributed in the polar, temperate, and
tropical waters of the western North Atlantic. They are
found from the pack ice south to at least Anguilla, Lesser
Antilles, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, though they appear
to be most abundant in temperate waters north of the latitude
of New York and are infrequently reported from tropical
waters. At least some of the population migrates to the
northern portions of their range in spring and back south in
autumn. They often approach close to shore and enter river
mouths, inlets, and estuaries.</p>

<p>Minke whales arrive along the Canadian coast in May or
June. Some migrate as far north as Hudson Strait, where
they remain until the freeze in October, November, or
December. By December the majority of the population has
begun to move to the south, although some animals remain
behind so long as to become entrapped in the ice and die.
Spring and summer concentrations along the Canadian coast
correspond to concentrations of capelin, cod, and herring.
Southern concentrations, also corresponding with concentrations
of herring, extend farther offshore at least to the edges
of the Grand Bank. Minke whales also summer off the south
coast of western Greenland, which they probably reach from
waters southwest of Iceland. Minke whales also occur in
deep pelagic waters.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded minke whales can be most readily identified by:
1) their small size (to just over 30 feet [9.1 m]); 2) the
transverse white bands on the flippers; 3) the yellowish-white
baleen plates (up to half the posteriormost plates may
be brown or black), 300-325 per side in number and having
fine white bristles (the plates are up to 4.75 inches [12 cm]
wide at the base and up to 8 inches [20.3 cm] long); and 4) by
the 50-70 thin ventral grooves, ending well before the navel,
often just even with the flippers.</p>

<h4><a name="NORTHERN_BOTTLENOSED_WHALE_T" id="NORTHERN_BOTTLENOSED_WHALE_T"></a>NORTHERN BOTTLENOSED WHALE (T)
<br />
<i>Hyperoodon ampullatus</i> (Forster 1770)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>None known.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Northern bottlenosed whales reach a length of 32 feet (9.8
m) and are robust in form. They are characterized by a
bulbous forehead, which is more pronounced on larger
animals and most distinctive in adult males, and by the
dolphinlike beak displayed in animals of all sizes and ages,
which is sometimes visible as the animals surface steeply to
breathe.</p>

<p>The blowhole is located in an indented area behind the
bulbous forehead, and the blow emanating from it projects
upward or slightly forward to a height of up to 6 feet (1.8 m),
is bushy and is visible from a considerable distance under low
wind conditions. The dorsal fin, located two-thirds of the way
back on the back, reaches at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in height
and is distinctly falcate. The dorsal fin may be visible from a
distance of several hundred meters.</p>

<p>Northern bottlenosed whales are usually brownish in
color, though the markings change with age. Smaller animals
are a uniform chocolate brown. Larger animals retain the
chocolate brown color on the back but are often lighter on the
sides and the belly and often have irregular patches or
blotches of grayish-white coloration on the back and sides.
Extremely large animals, presumably older males, often
have a white head. The flippers and the undersides of the
flukes are uniformly brown in color.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Northern bottlenosed whales often form tightly packed
groups of up to 10 or more animals. This species holds the
anecdotal record for the longest dives, having been reported
by early whalers to remain submerged over 2 h. They are
probably deep divers, feeding primarily on squid (though
they may take fishes as well), and they rarely go in water
shallower than 100 fathoms (183 m).</p>

<p>After a long dive, northern bottlenosed whales will
sometimes remain on the surface for 10 min or more, blowing
at regular intervals before making another dive. After the
last blow of a series or when the animals are startled by a
boat, they may show the tail flukes as they begin to dive. The
flukes are not notched on the rear margin.</p>

<p>Northern bottlenosed whales have been observed to show
curiosity about boats, coming to them from a considerable
distance. They have also been observed to "lobtail," raising
the tail flukes above the water and slapping them against the
surface, and to jump clear of the water.</p>

<p>In the late 19th century, after stocks of bowhead whales
were severely reduced by overwhaling, northern bottlenosed
whales became a prime target of arctic whalers. They were
sought because in addition to whale oil produced from the
body blubber, the forehead of the species yielded quantities
of spermaceti like that obtained from sperm whales.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Northern bottlenosed whales have a northerly and
deep-water distribution. Within their range, they may be
confused at a distance with minke whales, with sperm
whales, or perhaps with North Sea beaked whales.</p>

<p>Minke whales (p. <a href="#Page_63">63</a>) have a falcate dorsal fin located in
approximately the same position as that of the northern
bottlenosed whale. However, minke whales have a flathead in
front of their two blow holes and are black to dark gray
on the back.</p>

<p>Sperm whales (p. <a href="#Page_57">57</a>) have a squarish head that may
somewhat resemble that of an adult male northern
bottlenosed whale. However, there are numerous characteristics
which will permit these species to be distinguished even
from a distance:</p>

<td class="comp">Squarish, long, all black;

</table>

<p>A further aid to distinguishing northern bottlenosed
and sperm whales at sea is the fact that the
sperm whales that are found in areas where northern
bottlenosed whales are encountered are usually older,
larger males from 40 to 60 feet (12.2 to 18.3 m) long.
Northern bottlenosed whales do not exceed 32
feet (9.8 m).</p>

<p>Northern bottlenosed whales may also be confused with
the poorly known North Sea beaked whale (p. <a href="#Page_82">82</a>). When
they can be examined at close range, however, northern
bottlenosed whales should be distinguishable on the basis of
the distinctly bulbous forehead.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>In the western North Atlantic, northern bottlenosed
whales are restricted to Arctic and north temperate waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
where they most commonly occur in offshore areas. They
have been reported from Davis Straits and the entrance to
Hudson Strait, the Gully southeast of Sable Island, and as far
south as Narragansett Bay, R.I.</p>

<p>In the spring and summer they concentrate near the
northern limits of their range, occasionally visiting deep
channels of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and eastern
Newfoundland in summer. During these seasons they may
extend to the edge of the pack ice.</p>

<p>In the fall and winter the bulk of the population migrates
southward. Many probably winter in the Labrador Sea while
others move farther southward and farther offshore.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Like the beaked whales discussed on p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a> through <a href="#Page_83">83</a>,
the northern bottlenosed whales have no notch in the tail
flukes, have two throat grooves forming a V-shape on the
chin, and have only two teeth in the lower jaw, with those
teeth emerged from the gums only in adult males. These
teeth may have sometimes fallen out of older males, but the
tooth sockets should still be visible in the gums.</p>

<p>NOTE: Some specimens&mdash;both male and female&mdash;will be
found to have a series of vestigial teeth the size of toothpicks
in the upper and/or lower jaws. Similar vestigial teeth, 5-40
in number, sometimes occur in goosebeaked whales (p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>).
Further when they are prepared for museum collections, the
lower jaws of adult northern bottlenosed whales may be
found to contain a second pair of teeth just behind the first.</p>

<p>Northern bottlenosed whales may be distinguished from
the remainder of the beaked whale family, however, by the
extremely robust body, by the bulbous forehead, which is
more extensively developed in larger animals, particularly
males, and by the pronounced dolphinlike beak.</p>

<br />
<i>Ziphius cavirostris</i> G. Cuvier 1823</h4>

<h5>Other Common Names</h5>


<p>Ziphius, Cuvier's beaked whale, grampus (St. Vincent)
(see also p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Goosebeaked whales reach a length of 23 feet (7 m).
Females are slightly larger than males of the same age.
Calves are probably less than about 6 feet (1.8 m) at birth.
The head is small relative to the body length and, when
viewed laterally, is slightly concaved or scooped on the upper
margin. The cleft of the mouth is small, smaller than in any
other species of beaked whales. The beak is indistinct in
larger individuals. There is a distinct indentation on the back
behind the head. Two teeth are found at the tip of the lower
jaw of adult males only.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is relatively tall and distinct, to at least 15
inches (38.1 cm), smoothly falcate, and located well behind
the midpoint of the back. The blowhole is located far forward
on the top of the head. The blow, which may project slightly
forward and slightly off to the left, is usually low and
inconspicuous. Though the first blow after a long dive may be
more distinct, even it is rarely visible even under good wind
conditions for more than a few hundred yards.</p>

<p>Descriptions of the color pattern vary. Individuals may be
dark rust brown, slate gray, or fawn colored on the back and
generally lighter on the belly. Some appear dark in both
regions, still others&mdash;particularly youngsters&mdash;appear lighter
gray or tan on the belly. The body is frequently covered
with white or cream-colored blotches (particularly on the
belly). The tail flukes are dark on the bottom. The head is
frequently paler in color. Old males have a distinct white head
and are frequently extensively scarred.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Goosebeaked whales frequently occur in groups of from 10
to as many as 25 individuals. They have been reported to
jump clear of the water. They are presumably deep divers
and are known to stay down for more than 30 min. When they
begin a deep dive, they often raise their tail flukes above the
surface and dive nearly vertically. Goosebeaked whales feed
primarily on squid.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>So little is known of the external appearance and behavior
of the living beaked whales at sea that all the species may
easily be confused.</p>

<p>Goosebeaked whales are larger than all other beaked
whale species with the exception of the northern bottlenosed
whale. Upon close examination they may be distinguished
from the northern bottlenosed whale by the lighter coloration
of the head, reaching an extreme in the white head of adult
males. (See p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a> and <a href="#Figure_75">Fig. 75</a>.)</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>As with other species of beaked whales seldom
encountered or at least seldom positively identified at sea,
the distribution of goosebeaked whales is poorly known and
must be constructed from records of stranded specimens.
Such records, often involving sick individuals that may have
washed ashore from considerable distances, may give an
inaccurate picture of normal ranges.</p>

<p>In general, stranding reports suggest that goosebeaked
whales are sparsely but widely distributed in nonpolar
latitudes. They appear to be primarily tropical in
distribution, though they venture into temperate areas in
summer. They have been reported from Massachusetts and
Rhode Island south to Florida and thence to the islands of the
West Indies. They are frequently stranded along the Florida
coast and are not an uncommon species in the extant whale
fishery of the Antillean Islands. The fact that goosebeaked
whales strand more frequently than other beaked whales
may reflect either a greater abundance or a greater tendency
to approach close to shore.</p>

<p>They are probably primarily an offshore species.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>To be positively identified, stranded goosebeaked whales
in an advanced state of decomposition may require museum
preparation and examination of the skull and teeth. Fresh
specimens may be tentatively identified by the characters
illustrated in the figures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="OTHER_BEAKED_WHALES_T" id="OTHER_BEAKED_WHALES_T"></a>OTHER BEAKED WHALES (T)
<br />
<i>Mesoplodon</i> spp.</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Grampus (St. Vincent) (see also p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>In addition to the northern bottlenosed whale (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>) and
the goosebeaked whale (p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>), four other species of beaked
whales have been reported from the western North Atlantic.
All four species are known primarily from stranded
specimens and have been rarely encountered at sea.
Therefore statements of range are usually limited to
inferences from locations of strandings, and information on
appearance and habits of the species in the wild is almost
totally lacking.</p>

<p>The infrequent encounters with beaked whales at sea may
result from such factors as 1) a low inconspicuous blow, 2)
avoidance of ships, and/or 3) distribution in small groups in
offshore areas well outside the normal boating lanes.</p>

<p>The following descriptions will aid primarily in identifying
stranded specimens. Though subtle differences in ranges,
color patterns, and dorsal fin shapes and positions may be
helpful in narrowing the choices of living animals, the species
will continue to be extremely difficult to distinguish from one
another in the brief encounters typical at sea until additional
data are collected.</p>

<p>The beaked whales have the following characteristics in
common: 1) two small creases forming a V-shape on the throat,
2) the absence of a conspicuous notch on the rear margin of the
tail flukes (some specimens have a slight indentation), and 3)
the absence of functional teeth in all except adult males.
Adult males have a single pair of teeth in the lower jaw, the
position and description of which help to identify the species.
The teeth of females are not functional and only rarely
emerge from the gums. Therefore, if a stranded animal is an
adult male, its species can be determined by the position and
description of the teeth. For example, in <i>Mesoplodon mirus</i>,

<br />
<i>Mesoplodon minis</i> True 1913</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>None known.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>True's beaked whales reach a length of at least 16 feet (4.9
m) long. They are chunky in midbody and narrow rapidly
towards the tail, closely resembling goosebeaked whales
(p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>). In overall body shape, the head is small with a slight
indentation in the area of the blowhole, a slight bulge to the
forehead, and a pronounced beak. The flippers are small
(from one-fourteenth to one-tenth the body length). The
dorsal fin is small, slightly falcate, located in the latter third
of the back, and followed by a pronounced ridge on the tail
stock. The flukes, which sometimes contain a very slight
notch, are broad (to almost one-fifth the body length).</p>

<p>True's beaked whales are dull black to dark gray on the
back, lighter slate gray on the sides, and white on the belly.
The body is frequently covered with light colored spots or
splotches and bears numerous pairs of scratch marks,
presumably tooth rakes (<a href="#Figure_76">Fig. 76</a>).</p>

<p>The flippers are all black and are attached in the dark coloration
of the animal's side. The flukes are dark above and
below.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>True's beaked whales are most likely to be confused with
goosebeaked whales (p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>) but may also be confused with
any of the other beaked whales species (p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a> and <a href="#Figure_78">Fig. 78</a>).</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>True's beaked whales appear to be primarily temperate in
distribution. They have been reported from Cape Breton
Island, Nova Scotia south as far as Flagler Beach in Florida.
Northernmost records are for summer months.</p>

<p>The range of True's beaked whales overlaps with that of
the Antillean beaked whale but is more northerly.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>The teeth of adult male True's beaked whales may be
visible near the tip of the lower jaw, a characteristic shared
with the goosebeaked whale (p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>) and the northern
bottlenosed whale (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>). Both these other species reach
substantially greater maximum lengths than True's beaked
whales, however, and should be readily distinguishable by
this and the number of other highly distinctive characteristics
of each species.</p>

<p>Females and subadult males may be confused with any of
the beaked whales species (p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a> and <a href="#Figure_78">Fig. 78</a>).</p>

<p>Gulfstream beaked whale, Gervais' beaked whale.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Antillean beaked whales reach a length of at least 22 feet
(6.7 m). They are slender in form and appear somewhat
laterally compressed (i.e., taller than they are wide). The
head is extremely small and tapers rapidly to a narrow beak.
The flippers are small (to about one-twelfth the body length)
with their origin well down on the sides of the body. The
dorsal fin is small, located behind the midpoint of the back,
and variable in shape from falcate to triangular. The flukes
are less than one-fifth the body length and are not notched.</p>

<p>Antillean beaked whales are dark grayish black on the
back and sides, slightly lighter on the abdomen. The flukes

<br />
<i>Mesoplodon densirostris</i> (Blainville in Desmarest 1817)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>None known.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Dense-beaked whales reach a length of at least 17 feet (5.2
m). The body is distinctly spindle-shaped. The head, the
contour of which is the most distinctive characteristic of this
species, is marked by a prominent rise, located near the angle
of the gape on each side. This rise, which bears the teeth,
gives a peculiar high, arching contour to the mouth (<a href="#Figure_84">Fig. 84</a>),
particularly in adult males.</p>

<p>The flippers are small (one-eleventh to one-tenth the body
length) and have their origin in the lighter color of the lower
sides. The dorsal fin varies from small and triangular to
nearly falcate and pointed on the tip. It is located behind the
midpoint of the back. The flukes are from one-sixth to
one-fifth the body length, are seldom notched, and
occasionally even bulge slightly backwards near the center of
the rear margin.</p>

<p>Dense-beaked whales are black or charcoal gray on the
back, slightly lighter on the abdomen. They are somewhat
blotched with grayish white and are often extensively
scratched or scarred. The flippers are lighter than the back.
The flukes are dark above, light below.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>From stomach contents of stranded animals dense-beaked
whales are known to feed on squid.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Adult male dense-beaked whales can be separated from
the other beaked whales by the high, arching contour to the
corners of the mouth. If there is no adult male in the group,
however, dense-beaked whales may be confused with any of
the other beaked whales species.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Dense-beaked whales have been reported from Peggys
Cove, Nova Scotia south to Florida. From all accounts, this
species appears widely but sparsely distributed in warm
temperate seas.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Adults of this species should be distinguishable by the
highly distinctive contour of the mouth. The teeth, located in
the high rise of the mouth, are oriented slightly backwards.</p>

<h5>Description</h5>

<p>North Sea beaked whales reach a length of at least 16.5
feet (5 m). The body is distinctly spindle-shaped, but
apparently more robust near midbody than that of the

<h4><a name="KILLER_WHALE_T" id="KILLER_WHALE_T"></a>KILLER WHALE (T)
<br />
<i>Orcinus orca</i> (Linnaeus 1758)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Blackfish (see also pilot whales, p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a> and <a href="#Page_94">94</a>), sword fish
(Canada), grampus (see p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>), whitefish (St. Vincent),
Espladon (Quebec).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Killer whales are the largest member of the dolphin
family. Adult males reach a length of at least 30 feet (9.1 m)
and are robust in form. One specimen of 31 feet (9.5 m) was
recorded for the western North Pacific. Females are
considerably smaller and less stocky. Newborn are
approximately 7-8 feet (2.1-2.4 m) long. Killer whales have
large paddle-shaped flippers.</p>

<p>The most distinctive field character of the species is the
dorsal fin. In adult males it is extremely erect and may be as
much as 6 feet (1.8 m) tall. Though the fin of females and
immature males is less than 3 feet (0.9 m) tall, it is
nonetheless taller even in these animals than in any other
cetacean species and is distinctly falcate and pointed on the
tip.</p>

<p>Killer whales are basically black with an extensive region
of white on the undersides extending from the lower jaw to
the anal region with a branch extending onto the flanks
behind the dorsal fin. There is an oval white patch on the side
of the head just above and behind the eye. In newborn and
very young calves, these regions may be tan to lemon yellow
in color. Most animals have a light-gray saddle marking just
behind the dorsal fin. The undersides of the flukes are
usually white. Both all-black and all-white animals have
been reported.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Killer whales travel in groups of from a few to 25 or 30
individuals, though herds of 150 have been reported. Males
appear polygamous, and females and young may form groups
separate from young bachelors and bulls.</p>

<p>Killer whales are extremely fast swimmers, capable of
reaching top speeds of 25 knots or more, and have been
reported "porpoising" and breaching. Individuals and entire
groups have also been reported "spy-hopping," or
"pitchpoling," behaviors which consist of hanging vertically
in the water with the head and much of the body (to just
behind the flippers) exposed above the surface.</p>

<p>Killer whales feed on squid, fishes, sea turtles, seabirds,
and marine mammals.</p>

<p>Controversy still continues over whether or not killer
whales pose a threat to man. Documented attacks of killer
whales on boats are rare and have usually been provoked
(i.e., harpooning or attempts to capture). Only two uncertain
instances of attacks in the wild have been reported, but all
divers and mariners should be cautioned that this powerful
animal is perfectly capable of doing tremendous damage and
should not be provoked.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Because of its very distinctive dorsal fin, body shape, and
coloration, the killer whale is not likely to be confused with
any other whale when it can be examined at close range or
when an adult male is present in the group. Pods of females
and immature animals, however, may be confused with false
killer whales or with grampus. The killer whales may be
distinguished from false killers by the following differences:</p>

</table>

<p>Furthermore, false killer whales are the only "blackfish"
which are known to ride the bow wave of a ship.</p>

<p>Grampus have a tall dorsal fin (15 inches [38.1 cm]) which
is very similar in appearance to that of adult female and
juvenile killer whales. But grampus have much lighter
coloration, from slate gray to nearly all white, and larger
animals are covered with numerous scratches. Upon closer
examination they can be further distinguished from killer
whales by a crease in the front of the head dividing the melon
into two distinct sections. Grampus are considerably smaller,
to about 13 feet (4 m) maximum length.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>In the western North Atlantic killer whales have been
reported from the polar pack ice south to Florida and St.
Vincent, Lesser Antilles, and into the Gulf of Mexico at least
as far as Texas, though they are far more common in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
cooler waters from about New Jersey north. Throughout
their range, killer whales seem to prefer coastal areas and
often enter shallow bays, estuaries, and river mouths in
search of food.</p>

<p>Migrations of the species are probably closely tied to
movements of their food supply. They annually arrive on the
coast of New England with the tuna. Along the Canadian
coasts, where distribution and migrations have been
described in some detail, killer whales appear to move
inshore in spring and summer. Many arrive off the east coast
of Newfoundland in June, the Strait of Belle Isle in June and
July, and slightly later along the Labrador coast and Arctic
waters. They are found around the loose ice in April,
presumably feeding on harp seals, <i>Pagophilus groenlandicus</i>,
and hooded seals, <i>Cystophora cristata</i>, and are frequent in
the St. Lawrence estuary in spring and autumn following the
movements of the white whales. The northward movements
in spring also coincide with migrations of balaenopterine
whales, which have also been reported among the food items.
Killer whales may remain in arctic or subarctic waters until
driven out by new forming ice in October and November.
Though the migration has not been as thoroughly described,
killer whales apparently begin shifting southwards in
autumn.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded killer whales should be readily identifiable by
the robust body, the distinctive body markings, and in larger
animals the tall dorsal fin. Killer whales have from 10 to 12
large, prominent teeth on each side of the upper and lower
jaws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="FALSE_KILLER_WHALE_T" id="FALSE_KILLER_WHALE_T"></a>FALSE KILLER WHALE (T)
<br />
<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i> (Owen 1846)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Mongoose (St. Vincent).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>False killer whales in the western North Atlantic reach a
length of at least 18 feet (5.5 m). Males are slightly larger
than females. Calves from 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1 m) may be
seen at any time throughout the year.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin, located just behind the midpoint of the
back, is from 7 to 16 inches (17.8 to 40.6 cm) tall, falcate, and
variable to sharply pointed on the tip. The flippers are
characterized by a broad hump on the front margin near the
middle, a characteristic which is diagnostic for the species.</p>

<p>The body of the species is all black except for a blaze of
gray on the belly between the flippers. This blaze varies from
barely visible to light grayish white similar to but generally
fainter than that of pilot whales. The body is long and slender,
and the head is narrow and gently tapered from the area of
the blowhole forward.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>False killer whales are a social form and may occur in
herds of up to at least 100 individuals. They often jump clear
of the water and frequently ride the bow waves of vessels.
They are the only "blackfish" which are known to do so. False
killer whales feed primarily on squid and large fishes and are
notorious for their habit of stealing fish from the lines of
fishermen. The large prominent teeth may be visible on a
swimming animal.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>False killer whales may be confused with killer whales,
pilot whales, or the smaller, poorly known pygmy killer whale
(p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>) and many-toothed blackfish (p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>).</p>

<p>The characteristics distinguishing the species from the
killer whale are tabularized on p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>; its differences from the
pilot whales are summarized on p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a>.</p>

<p>At sea, false killer whales are distinguishable from the
other two species primarily by their larger size and
differences in coloration. False killer whales are up to 18 feet
(5.5 m) in length. Pygmy killer whales and many-toothed
blackfish reach only 8-9 feet (2.4-2.7 m) in length. Pygmy
killer whales have an extensive region of white on the belly
which may extend onto the sides and both pygmy killer whales
and many-toothed blackfish have a distinctive white region
on the lips, usually lacking or indistinct on false killer whales.</p>

<p>Neither of the smaller species of blackfish has been
reported to ride bow waves.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>False killer whales are widely distributed in the pelagic
tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters of the
western North Atlantic. They have been reported from off
Maryland south along the mainland coasts of North America,
in the Gulf of Mexico from Cuba and the Lesser Antilles, and
from the southeast Caribbean Sea. The species has been
reported from Venezuela.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded false killer whales can be positively identified
by: 1) the large size (to 18 feet [5.5 m]); 2) the slender body
tapering rapidly to a long slender head; 3) the markedly long
mouth, with from 8 to 11 large, conspicuous teeth in each side
of each jaw recalling those of the killer whale, but circular and
not, as in killer whales, elliptical; 4) the unusually shaped
flipper bulging conspicuously on the forward margin.</p>

<p>For comparison with "blackfish" of similar size (the pilot
whales) see p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a> and <a href="#Page_94">94</a>.</p>

<p>False killer whales do not appear to occur frequently in
coastal waters, sandy bays, or estuaries, though entire herds
have stranded in such areas. Records from throughout the
range suggest that the species has an oceanic distribution.</p>

<h4><a name="ATLANTIC_PILOT_WHALE_T" id="ATLANTIC_PILOT_WHALE_T"></a>ATLANTIC PILOT WHALE (T)
<br />
<i>Globicephala melaena</i> (Traill 1809)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Northern pilot whale, long-finned pilot whale, pothead,
blackfish, calling whale, caa'ing whale.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Male Atlantic pilot whales reach an average length of at
least 20 feet (6.2 m). Females are slightly smaller, probably
not exceeding 18 feet (5.5 m). Young are 5-7 feet (1.5-2.1 m) at
birth.</p>

<p>The head is thick and bulbous, a characteristic which
reaches an extreme in the development of the head of adult
males (prompting the common name "pothead"). The flippers
are long (to one-fifth of the body length, or more) and
sickle-shaped. The tail is dorsally thickened just in front of
the flukes.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin of this species is one of its most distinctive
characteristics. It is low in profile, has a long base, is set far
forward on the animal's back, and is falcate to "flaglike" in
appearance. The dorsal fin of adult males reportedly has a
thicker leading edge and a rounder form than that of the
female.</p>

<p>Atlantic pilot whales are black on the back and sides
(prompting the common name "blackfish") but have an
anchor-shaped patch of grayish white on the chin and a gray
area on the belly, both of which are variable in extent and
intensity. Some larger animals have a gray saddle behind the
dorsal fin, though this zone of color is found more frequently
in short-finned pilot whales. Young animals are often a lighter
medium gray.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Atlantic pilot whales may occur in herds of 200 animals or
more, though herds of 50 or fewer (4-6) are more common.
They are sometimes found in association with Atlantic
white-sided dolphins.</p>

<p>Pilot whales are sometimes found hanging vertically in
the water with the head and part of the back out of the water
in what has been called "spy-hopping" or "pitchpoling."
Individuals frequently lobtail. Pilot whales infrequently
breach, a behavior which is usually confined to younger
animals. They do not ride bow waves.</p>

<p>Atlantic pilot whales feed primarily on squid but also take
cod and other fishes. A Pacific pilot whale, a closely related
species, was found by radio telemetric studies to be capable of
diving to 2,000 feet (609.6 m).</p>

<p>Atlantic pilot whales were formerly the object of an active
shore fishery off Newfoundland (1950-1971). In addition,
entire herds and, less frequently, individuals are sometimes
stranded.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Atlantic pilot whales are most likely to be confused with
false killer whales, with which they share the waters from off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Virginia to those off Maryland. The two species may be
distinguished by the following characteristics:</p>

<p>In the extreme southern portion of their range, Atlantic pilot
whales may be confused with short-finned pilot whales with
which they have only a limited seasonal common range. Characters
distinguishing these species are subtle and may not be
adequate to permit them to be distinguished at sea. For purposes
of this guide it is generally that pilot whales living north
of lat. 38&deg;N (Virginia coast) are Atlantic pilot whales and
those living south of lat. 38&deg;N are short-finned pilot whales.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Atlantic pilot whales, the northernmost of the two pilot
whales species, are found in winter from the Grand Banks
south as far as North Carolina and in summer from Iceland
and Greenland south to the New Jersey coast. Winter
concentrations of pilot whales may be found off the
Newfoundland coast and near Cape Cod, Mass. Atlantic pilot
whales are distributed both in coastal waters and in deep
waters off the continental shelf.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>As discussed above, individuals and groups of pilot whales
frequently strand themselves for still incompletely understood
reasons. They may be identified as pilot whales
primarily by: 1) the robust body and bulbous head, which is
often squarish in adult animals, and 2) the broad-based,
falcate dorsal fin located far forward on the back. Accurate
determination of the pilot whale species involved in the
stranding may require museum preparation of the skull and
detailed examination of its characteristics. Preliminary
identification may be made, however, based on the following:</p>

<br />
<i>Globicephala macrorhynchus</i> Gray 1846</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Blackfish (see also p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>, <a href="#Page_91">91</a>, and <a href="#Page_94">94</a>).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Male short-finned pilot whales of the western North
Atlantic reach lengths of at least 17.5 feet (5.3 m). Females
are reportedly slightly smaller than males (recorded only to
15.5 feet [4.7 m]).</p>

<p>The head, somewhat like that of the Atlantic pilot whales
(p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>), is thick and bulbous, a characteristic which reaches
its extreme in the development of a flattened or squarish
appearance to the front of the head in mature males (see
Fig. 101). In very old males the melon may overhang the
mouth up to several inches. The flippers are shorter than
those of the other pilot whale species of the western North
Atlantic (thus the common name short-finned pilot whale),
reaching only one-sixth of the body length or less. The tail is
dorsoventrally thickened just in front of the flukes.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin, like that of the Atlantic pilot whale, is one
of the species' most distinctive characteristics. It is low in
profile, has a long base, and is set far forward on the animal's
back.</p>

<p>Short-finned pilot whales are all black on the back sides
and most of the belly with an anchor-shaped patch of gray on
the chin and a gray area of varying extent and intensity on the
belly. These areas are less vivid and extensive than those on
Atlantic pilot whales. Younger animals are lighter, often
medium gray.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Short-finned pilot whales are known to occur in groups of
60 animals or more, though smaller groups are more common.
They have been reported pitchpoling (spy-hopping), lobtailing,
and&mdash;rarely&mdash;breaching.</p>

<p>Short-finned pilot whales feed on squid and fish.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>In the tropical portion of their range, short-finned
pilot whales may be confused with pygmy killer
whales (p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>) and many-toothed blackfish (p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>).
They may be distinguished from both species primarily
by their distinctive dorsal fin and the bulbous-to-squarish
head. Both pygmy killer whales and
many-toothed blackfish have dorsal fins, which are
more falcate, slender, and pointed on the tip, and have
longer, slenderer heads.</p>

<p>Throughout their range short-finned pilot whales may be
confused with false killer whales. The two species may be distinguished
by the same differences which distinguish Atlantic
pilot whales from false killer whales (p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>).</p>

<p>In the extreme northern portion of their range,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
short-finned pilot whales may be confused with Atlantic pilot
whales. The two species may be distinguished by differences
itemized on p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Though short-finned pilot whales are known from
Delaware Bay, their normal range appears to extend from
Bermuda and Cape Hatteras (Virginia in summer) south
to the Venezuelan coast. They have been reported for
the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the islands of the
West Indies.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded short-finned pilot whales may be confused with
any of the species itemized under living animals. They may be
identified as pilot whales primarily by the robust body and
bulbous head, often squarish in adult animals, and the
broad-based, falcate dorsal fin located well forward on the
animal's back. Accurate determination of the pilot whale
species involved may require museum preparation of the
skull and detailed examination of its characteristics.
Preliminary identification may be made, however, on the
basis of the following:</p>

<h4><a name="GRAMPUS_T" id="GRAMPUS_T"></a>GRAMPUS (T)
<br />
<i>Grampus griseus</i> (G. Cuvier 1812)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Risso's dolphin, gray grampus, white-headed grampus,
mottled grampus, Risso's porpoise, hard knocks (St.
Vincent), white blackfish (Cape Cod).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Grampus reach a maximum length of about 13 feet (4 m).
The body is robust, particularly in front of the dorsal fin, and
lacks a distinct beak. The head is somewhat bulbous and is
marked on the front by a V-shaped crease with the point
downwards, which divides the melon into two parts. The
flippers are long and pointed on the tips. The dorsal fin,
located at about the midpoint of the body, is tall, to 15 inches
(38.1 cm) or more, and distinctly falcate. The body narrows
rapidly behind the dorsal fin and the tail stock is quite
narrow. The flukes are broad, concaved on the rear margin,
and deeply notched.</p>

<p>The bodies of grampus are a uniform light gray at birth.
As the animals age, their color darkens to almost black with
distinctive regions of grayish white on the belly and chest.
The body of older adults is cream white or silver gray,
particularly on the head, with numerous scars, presumably
from encounters with other grampus and perhaps with the
squid, which are one of the species' major food items.</p>

<p>The flippers, dorsal fin, and tail flukes usually remain
dark even in adults.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Grampus are found in herds of up to several hundred
individuals and may be seen "porpoising" (leaping from the
water) as they surface to breathe, and breaching. They
sometimes ride the bow waves of a boat.</p>

<p>Grampus feed on fish and squid.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>From a distance grampus are most easily confused with
Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins. They may be most readily
distinguished by the following differences:</p>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Grampus are known to be distributed in temperate and
tropical seas from at least eastern Newfoundland, south at
least to St. Vincent, Lesser Antilles, and in the eastern and
northern Gulf of Mexico. The species may not be as rare as the
paucity of records suggests. Though they have been seen in
Buzzards Bay on several occasions, grampus generally have
an oceanic range and, along the Atlantic coast of North
America, may be distributed from the Gulf Stream seaward,
outside the theater of normal boating traffic.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded grampus are most readily identifiable by 1) the
presence of only seven, or fewer, teeth in each side of the
lower jaw (many of those teeth may have dropped out in older
animals and remaining teeth may be extensively worn) and
the absence of teeth in the upper jaw; 2) the presence of a
distinct crease or bifurcation in the melon on the extreme
front of the head; 3) the presence of numerous scratches and
scars all over the body; and 4) the tall, slender, sharply falcate
dorsal fin which may be more than 15 inches (38.1 cm) tall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="Medium-sized_Whales_Without_a_Dorsal_Fin" id="Medium-sized_Whales_Without_a_Dorsal_Fin"></a>Medium-sized Whales Without a Dorsal Fin</h3>

<h4><a name="BELUGA_T" id="BELUGA_T"></a>BELUGA (T)
<br />
<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i> (Pallas 1776)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>White porpoise, white whale, belukha, sea canary,
marsouin blanc (Quebec).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Belugas reach a maximum overall length of about 16 feet
(4.9 m). Males are slightly larger than females. In the western
North Atlantic they have been found to grow to greatest
lengths in oceanic environments near the southern
extremities of their ranges, though they are found in far
greater abundance in estuarine areas of the Arctic. Belugas
have extremely robust bodies tapering to a distinct "neck"
region and a very small head relative to body size.</p>

<p>They do not have a dorsal fin. Instead, along the back just
behind the midpoint there is a narrow ridge notched laterally
to form a series of small bumps. These ridges may be clearly
visible on a swimming animal.</p>

<p>Newborn belugas are brown. As they age, they gradually
lighten through slate gray, and by their sixth or seventh year
have assumed the all-white coloration characteristic of adult
animals.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Belugas feed on a variety of fishes (including cod and
capelin), on squid, and on a variety of benthic crustaceans.</p>

<p>They are frequently found in shallow bays and river
mouths, where the young are born, and occasionally ascend
rivers.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Because of their limited distribution, all-white coloration
and lack of a dorsal fin, belugas are unlikely to be confused
with any other species of cetacean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Belugas have been reported from the Arctic Circle south
as far as eastern Connecticut, typically in estuarine habitats,
though they do range into oceanic regions. They are most
abundant from the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence
northward. They remain near the Arctic Circle and in Hudson
Bay to northern Greenland during winter, undertaking
migrations to the south in autumn, straggling to the Maritime
Provinces and as far as Connecticut. Belugas are regularly
seen in the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers throughout
late spring and summer. Return migrations to the north take
place in spring.</p>

<p>A small population in the estuary of St. Lawrence is
resident throughout the year.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded belugas are unlikely to be confused with any
other species of cetaceans. The all-white coloration, the
robust body shape with a rather small head and a distinct
neck region, and the presence of 8-11 teeth in each of the
upper jaws and 8-9 in each of the lower jaws permit positive
identification.</p>

<h4><a name="NARWHAL_T" id="NARWHAL_T"></a>NARWHAL (T)
<br />
<i>Monodon monoceros</i> Linnaeus 1758</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Unicorn whale (historical name not currently in use).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>The narwhal, also known as the unicorn whale because of
the long tusk found on adult males, is one of two
medium-sized whales found in the Arctic waters of the
northwestern Atlantic. They reach a maximum length of
from 15 to 16 feet (4.6 to 4.9 m) excluding the tusk. Newborn
calves are approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Narwhals have
small rounded heads and a small mouth. Like the other
medium-sized whale in the same region, the beluga or white
whale, the narwhal has no dorsal fin. Instead, it has a series of
bumps, approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) high along the
midline of the back in the half nearest the tail. The ridge
created by these bumps may be readily seen on a swimming
animal.</p>

<p>The basic coloration of the species changes slightly with
age. Young animals are uniformly dark bluish gray on the
back but rapidly begin to develop the numerous leopardlike
spots on the back and sides characteristic of adults. Those
spots rarely extend onto the belly even in old animals.</p>

<p>Narwhals have only two teeth. In the females, these teeth
rarely emerge from the gums. In males, one and sometimes
both of those teeth grow out the front of the snout, spiraling
in a left-hand or sinistral direction, and may reach a length
of 9 feet (2.7 m). One or two tusks may also be exposed,
however, in females.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>The function of the tusk in male narwhals is unknown, but
it was this feature of the animal that earned it the name
"unicorn whale" and resulted in its extensive hunting by
whalers. During their annual migrations narwhals may
congregate but are commonly found in groups of 10 or fewer
during the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Narwhals feed on a variety of organisms, including cod,
rockfish, flounder, and crabs, but their diet consists primarily
of squid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Narwhals are found in the high arctic seas of the western
North Atlantic, primarily in Lancaster Sound and its fringes.
It has been noted that they are found in isolated pockets
within that range and are not, like the beluga, widely
distributed.</p>

<p>Narwhals make annual migrations in response to the
movement of the ice. During the fall as the ice begins to
form, the whales migrate to the south, sometimes reaching
the Labrador coast. In the spring they return to the
pack ice.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Narwhals are so different in coloration from the only
medium-sized cetacean which shares its range and
habitat&mdash;the beluga&mdash;that the two are highly unlikely to be
confused. Belugas are usually all white or light slate gray in
color, while narwhals are very much darker, ranging from
bluish gray to brownish, and are often covered with light
leopardlike spots. Furthermore, the body of the beluga is
more robust.</p>

<p>Further, swimming narwhals frequently buck their heads
up to breathe, a behavior which makes the tusk of adult males
visible and permits positive identification.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded narwhals should be easily identifiable by the
distinctive coloration and the unique characteristics of the
teeth. In adults, one or two of the teeth may develop into the
long, left-hand spiraling tusk, shown in Figures 112 and 114.
Immature animals have no teeth which are emerged.</p>

widely used for this species. It is now more frequently used for <i>Stenella
longirostris</i>, also known as the spinner dolphin.</p></div>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Atlantic spotted dolphins reach a maximum adult length
of 7.5, perhaps 8 feet (2.3 to 2.4 m). They are generally more
robust in body shape than the other species of Stenella,
closely resembling Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins in that
regard, though the Atlantic spotted dolphins tend to be more
slender.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is distinctly back-curved and pointed on the
tip, also closely resembling that of the Atlantic bottlenosed
dolphin.</p>

<p>As the common name suggests, the Atlantic spotted
dolphins are marked dorsally with numerous grayish-white
spots on a darker background and ventrally with dark spots
on a lighter background, though the extent of the spotting
and the additional details of coloration change with age.</p>

<p>Immature animals lack spots completely. They are dark
gray or purplish gray on the back, becoming lighter gray on
the sides and white on the belly. The cape along the back is
distinctly separated from the lighter gray coloration of the
sides. The flippers and the trailing edge of the flukes are
darker than the rest of the body.</p>

<p>As they age, the Atlantic spotted dolphins develop
grayish-white spots, first low on the sides, spreading
upward. During this stage, the cape becomes less distinct,
and dark spotting begins to develop on the belly, the spots
increasing in number with increasing age. In adult animals,
the belly is often extensively covered with dark blotches but
never becomes completely black. The lips may be white, and
the beak is characteristically tipped with white, a feature
which may aid in identification at sea.</p>

<p>The Atlantic spotted dolphins have a spinal blaze and a
light line which extends from the flipper to the eye.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Little is known of the natural history of the Atlantic
spotted dolphins. The species occurs in herds of up to several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
hundred individuals, though groups of 50 or fewer (6-10) are
more common. They are often seen jumping clear of the water
and habitually ride the bow wave of moving vessels. As they
do, the distinct cape or band of purplish gray on the back of
younger animals and the spotting pattern of older animals
may be visible.</p>

<p>Atlantic spotted dolphins feed primarily on squid but may
also take carangid fishes, small eels, herring, or anchovies.</p>


<h5>May Be confused With</h5>

<p>Atlantic spotted dolphins, particularly young animals,
may be easily confused with Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins
because of the similarities in color pattern and general body
shape. However, the Atlantic spotted dolphins have
considerable purplish gray in their background colors and the
Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins are more dark gray to brownish
gray. This along with considerable differences in the overall
sizes of the two species should permit positive identification.
In general, the key differences between spotted and
bottlenosed dolphins are as follows:</p>

<p>At sea the Atlantic spotted dolphins may also be confused
with rough-toothed dolphins (p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>).</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Atlantic spotted dolphins are a common species in the
continental waters of the tropical and warm temperate
western North Atlantic. Although they are far more
abundant south of Cape Hatteras, they have been reported
from the latitude of Cape May, N.J. (some fishermen claim to
have seen them even further north) south through the Gulf of
Mexico and the Caribbean to Venezuela. Atlantic spotted
dolphins may be replaced around the West Indies by the
bridled dolphin.</p>

<p>Within this range, the Atlantic spotted dolphins appear to
be generally restricted to the waters outside the 100-fathom
curve, most commonly more than 5 miles offshore. However,
populations in the Gulf of Mexico move inshore in the late
spring, and may approach close to shore during spring and
summer.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded Atlantic spotted dolphins may be difficult to
distinguish from bridled dolphins. If the color pattern is still
clearly visible, the differences in coloration described above,
particularly those of the head, and the presence or absence of
a spinal blaze may be used. But since external appearance
other than coloration are often very similar, specimens
should be photographed from as many aspects as possible and
the entire specimen or the roughed-out complete skeleton
transported to a museum for preparation and examination.
Tooth counts recorded for the two species to date are also
very similar.</p>

<h5>Other Common Names</h5>


<p>Bridled spotted dolphin, Cuvier's dolphin, gamin (St.
Vincent), bridled porpoise.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Bridled dolphins, the second species of spotted dolphins in
the western North Atlantic, reach an adult length of at least
7 feet (2.1 m). Like the other, the Atlantic spotted dolphin
(p. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>), bridled dolphins are characterized by light grayish-white
spots on the dark dorsal portions of the body and dark
spots on the light ventral surface. Other details of the
coloration differ somewhat. Bridled dolphins are dark gray
on the back, fading to lighter gray on the sides and belly.
They lack the spinal blaze characteristic of Atlantic spotted
dolphins. Except on the head, the border between the back
and side colors is indistinct. On the head, the cape (the dark
color of the top of the head) is distinct. In the light gray of
the side of the head are the markings from which the species
derives its common name, "bridled dolphin." These are a
black circle around the eye with an extension to the junction
(apex) of the rostrum and the melon (present in nearly all
dolphins) and a broad black stripe from the origin of the
flipper to the corner of the mouth. This mouth-to-flipper
stripe tends to fade as spotting increases. Both the upper
and lower lips are white or pinkish.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Virtually nothing is known of the natural history of
bridled dolphins except that they have been observed in small
herds of from 5 to 30 individuals and sometimes ride the bow
wave of a vessel.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>At sea, bridled dolphins may be confused with Atlantic
spotted dolphins or spinner dolphins. Differences by which
they may be distinguished from the first are tabularized on

</table>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Bridled dolphins occur in tropical and subtropical waters
primarily near coastal areas and islands, but are best known
from the West Indies. They have been reported from the
Antilles, from Texas, and from Florida north to North
Carolina. It has been speculated that this species replaces the
Atlantic spotted dolphin around the West Indies.</p>

<p>Bridled dolphins have not yet been described from the
South American coast.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Bridled dolphins have from 29 to 34 teeth in each upper
jaw and from 33 to 36 in each lower jaw. They can be
distinguished from spinner dolphins, which have 46-65 teeth
in each jaw, by this character alone.</p>

<p>They may be distinguished from spotted dolphins only if
the color pattern of the head is clearly visible. If it has faded,
the specimen will probably require museum preparation and
examination before it can be positively identified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<i>Stenella longirostris</i> Gray 1828</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Long-snouted dolphin, long-beaked porpoise, spinner
porpoise, rollover (St. Vincent).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Spinner dolphins reach a maximum length of about 7 feet
(2.1 m). The body is slender. The beak varies from extremely
long and slender (Fig. 123) to relatively short (Fig. 125); the
beak is usually dark on top and clean white below, though
there may be some white above. The tip of the snout and the
lips are distinctly black, while those of both species of spotted
dolphins are light. The back is dark gray to black, the sides
are tan to yellowish brown, and the belly is white. Some of the
larger animals appear almost all black with faint, light
speckling. The dorsal fin is generally moderately falcate, but
may be almost triangular in adult males. It is often a lighter
gray near the middle, bordered by black or dark gray.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Spinner dolphins derive their common name from
their habit of leaping clear of the water and spinning
on their longitudinal axis. The reasons for this behavior
are unknown. Individuals may rotate 2 times, or more,
in one leap but spinning behavior is not observed as
frequently in the western North Atlantic as it is in the
eastern tropical Pacific.</p>

<p>Spinner dolphins occur in herds of up to several hundred
individuals and are often seen jumping clear of the water,
working the sea surface into a froth. They frequently come to
the bow of a boat from considerable distances to ride in the
bow wave and may ride for protracted periods.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Spinner dolphins may be confused with saddleback
dolphins. Both species occur in large herds and often come to
moving vessels to ride the bow wave. The two can be
distinguished, however, by these differences:</p>

</table>

<p>Spinner dolphins might also be confused with bridled
dolphins, but may be distinguished by the differences
summarized on p. <a href="#Page_108">108</a>.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Spinner dolphins are distributed in oceanic and coastal
tropical waters. Though one specimen was collected from
South Carolina, they have been more frequently reported
from both coasts of Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the
Caribbean, and the West Indies. They have also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
reported from Venezuela. They are said to be the most
abundant dolphin species from the southeastern Caribbean.
Some Pacific spinner dolphins are distributed in oceanic
zones. Atlantic spinners may be abundant in offshore tropical
waters as well.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded spinner dolphins are most readily identified by
the extremely long rostrum and the 46-65 teeth, far more
than any other species of dolphin. Note that the striped
dolphins may have from 43 to 50 teeth per side in each jaw.
However, striped dolphins are decidedly larger (to about 9
feet [2.7 m]), have a shorter beak, and are distinctly marked
with dark stripes from the eye to the flipper, from the eye to
the anus, and from the area behind the dorsal fin forward,
towards but not reaching the head.</p>

<p>Saddleback dolphins also have from 40 to 50 teeth on each
side but are also easily distinguishable by the differences in
coloration discussed above for living animals at sea.</p>

<br />
<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i> (Meyen 1833)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Euphrosyne dolphin (<i>Stenella styx</i>), Meyen's dolphin,
blue-white dolphin, Gray's dolphin, striped porpoise,
streaker porpoise.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>The striped dolphin is a widely distributed relative of the
spinner and the Atlantic spotted dolphins, though it more
closely resembles saddleback dolphins than either of these
two species. It reaches a maximum length of about 9 feet (2.7
m) and is characterized by a series of distinctive black stripes.
One band of black begins near the eye and extends down the
side of the body to the area of the anus. (A small secondary
stripe originating with this band turns off and disappears in
the white coloration of the side just above the flippers.) A
second band of black extends from the eye to the flipper.
Some workers have contended that striped dolphins are
separable into distinct species depending on whether the
eye-to-flipper stripe has one (<i>S. coeruleoalba</i>) or two (<i>S. styx</i>)
components.</p>

<p>Most individuals have an additional distinctive finger of
black coloration which extends from the black coloration
behind the dorsal fin forward towards and about halfway to
the eye. It is this feature which is most distinctive in animals
riding the bow or leaping clear of the water. The back is dark
gray to bluish gray, the sides are lighter gray, and the belly is
white.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Though little is known of this species, it has been reported
in herds of up to several hundred individuals and apparently
exhibits behaviors very similar to those of the saddleback
dolphins (p. <a href="#Page_116">116</a>), frequently jumping clear of the water.
Atlantic and Mediterranean animals have been reported to
bow ride.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Striped dolphins are widely distributed in the temperate,
subtropical, and tropical seas of the western North Atlantic.
They have been reported from at least Halifax, Nova Scotia,
south as far as Jamaica. (Additional records, purportedly
from southern Greenland, involved a museum specimen.
Since striped dolphins of the eastern North Atlantic are rare
north of England, the species occurrence near Greenland
would be highly improbable.) Individuals have recently been
reported from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Despite this wide distribution, striped dolphins appear to
prefer warmer waters and are probably normally confined to
the Gulf Stream or the waters off the continental slope.
Individuals appearing to the north of the range seem to have
ventured northward with fingers of warm water.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded striped dolphins should be readily identifiable
by the highly distinctive patterns of lateral striping
discussed above for living animals. If the color pattern has
faded, they may still be identified by their size, larger than
other dolphin species of similar appearance, and the
relatively large number of teeth (43-50 per side in both
upper and lower jaws). Only the spinner dolphin, much
smaller in body length and having a much longer beak, has
more teeth (46-65 per side in each jaw).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

whether the eye-to-flipper stripe has one (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>) or two (<i>S. styx</i>) components. Others contend that the two belong to the same species
(<i>S. coeruleoalba</i>). Striped dolphins have from 43 to 50 teeth in each upper and lower jaw. (<i>Photos from Japan by W. E. Schevill [top] and from Indian

<h4><a name="SADDLEBACK_DOLPHIN_T" id="SADDLEBACK_DOLPHIN_T"></a>SADDLEBACK DOLPHIN (T)
<br />
<i>Delphinus delphis</i> Linnaeus 1758</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Saddleback porpoise, common dolphin, crisscross
dolphin.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Saddleback dolphins reach a maximum overall length of
about 8.5 feet (2.6 m) though most individuals are less than
7.5 feet (2.3 m) long. Males are slightly larger than females of
the same age.</p>

<p>The body shape varies slightly but usually closely resembles
that of the striped dolphin (p. <a href="#Page_113">113</a>). The dorsal fin
varies from nearly triangular to distinctly falcate and is
pointed on the tip. It is sometimes all black and sometimes
black on the borders with a lighter grayish region of varying
size near the middle.</p>

<p>The back is basically black or brownish black, but this
coloration and the extent of the striping patterns that form
the impression of a saddle and the degree of color distinction
between the different zones are highly variable.</p>

<p>The chest and belly are cream white to white and are the
most distinctive features from a distance. Up close, the sides
will be seen to be distinctly marked with an hourglass or
crisscross pattern of tan or yellowish tan. This crisscross
pattern is diagnostic for the species.</p>

<p>The rostrum is intermediate in length and shape between
that of the spinner and that of the striped dolphin and is often
black with a white tip.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Saddleback dolphins are often seen in herds of a thousand
or more and are often very active, many animals leaping clear
of the water at any time. Like spinner dolphins, saddleback
dolphins are active bow-riders and often come to the boat
from considerable distances. Once on the bow they often ride
for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>Saddleback dolphins feed on squid and on a variety of
fishes, including anchovies, myctophids, and hake.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Saddleback dolphins might easily be confused with
striped dolphins and must be examined closely to be
distinguished from them. Primary differences apparent in
encounters at sea are as follows:</p>

species of congregating in large schools with much jumping
and splashing. Both species ride the bow wave, and close
examination should permit positive identification using the
following characteristics:</p>

</table>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Saddleback dolphins are widely distributed in the
temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters of the western
North Atlantic Ocean. They have been reported off
Newfoundland, Iceland, Nova Scotia, and the coast of
Massachusetts, south along the coast of North America to the
Caribbean (West Indies and Jamaica), in the Gulf of Mexico,
and from South American waters at least to Margarita Island,
Venezuela.</p>

<p>The species' occurrence in the more northerly portions of
this range during the summer and early fall months appears
to coincide with the intrusion of warm waters into those
areas. They are not uncommon off Nova Scotia in summer
and fall and are casual members of the marine mammalian
fauna of the remaining Maritime Provinces during
that period.</p>

<p>In previous years, saddleback dolphins were not
uncommonly encountered by collectors of Marineland of
Florida working the northeast coast of Florida, but the
species has been conspicuously absent since about 1960.
Reasons for this apparent shift of range are unknown.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Saddleback dolphins have from 40 to 50 small, sharply
pointed teeth in each side of both the upper and lower jaws.
These numbers overlap with only those of the striped and
spinner dolphins (with 43-50 and 46-65, respectively).
Saddleback dolphins should be readily distinguishable from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
both these species by the features outlined under the
descriptions of living animals and distinguishable from the
bridled dolphins by the distinctive markings on the head of
the two species (see Figs. 121 and 134).</p>

<h4><a name="FRASERS_DOLPHIN_T" id="FRASERS_DOLPHIN_T"></a>FRASER'S DOLPHIN (T)
<br />
<i>Lagenodelphis hosei</i> Fraser 1956</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Sarawak dolphin, Bornean dolphin, Fraser's porpoise.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Fraser's dolphins reach an overall length of at least 8 feet
(2.4 m). They are extremely short-beaked and have a
pronounced dark stripe, similar to that found on the striped
dolphin, extending from the rostrum to the area of the anus.
They are robust in build and have rather small flippers and
dorsal fin relative to body size. The dorsal fin is slender,
falcate, and pointed on the tip. The body is gray on the back
and white on the belly. The color of the side is dominated by
the striping pattern. A cream-white band beginning high on
the rostrum extends above and past the eye, continues
towards the tail, and finally dissipates in the body color above
the anus. Just below and parallel to this cream-white band is a
black one extending from the area of the eye to the anus. A
second cream-white band below and parallel to this dark strip
separates the darker gray coloration of the side from the
white coloration of the belly. The flippers are dark above and
below.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>The little that is known of the natural history and behavior
of the species may be summarized as follows: Fraser's
dolphins occur in groups of up to at least 500 animals and in
the Pacific are occasionally seen with spotted dolphins
(<i>Stenella attenuata</i>). From all accounts, they are not
uncommon in certain areas of the tropical Pacific and off
South Africa.</p>

<p>Fraser's dolphins appear to be deep divers. They are
aggressive swimmers and, when they surface to breathe,
often charge to the surface, creating a spray from their heads.
They have also been reported leaping clear of the water.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Fraser's dolphin is intermediate in form between
<i>Lagenorhynchus</i> and <i>Delphinus delphis</i> (thus the composite
name <i>Lagenodelphis</i>). Because the species is apparently
limited to tropical waters, however, and because of the
prominent stripe on the side of the body, Fraser's dolphins
are more likely to be confused with the striped dolphins
(p. <a href="#Page_113">113</a>). The two species can be distinguished at sea by
several characteristics:</p>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Although Fraser's dolphins have yet to be described for
the western North Atlantic Ocean, they are included here as
"possibles" because of the recent discovery that their range is
far more extensive than previously known. Records to date
have been limited to offshore tropical waters.</p>

<p>The species was first described in 1956 from the remains
of a beach-washed specimen from Sarawak in the South China
Sea. Since that time specimens have been collected from the
eastern tropical Pacific, and others have stranded in such
widely divergent localities as Australia, South Africa, and
Japan. Recent summaries have added sighting records from
the Central Pacific, near the Phoenix Island, from northwest
of the Galapagos Islands, and from South African
waters.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded Fraser's dolphins should be readily identifiable
by 1) distinctive coloration of the body; 2) short, indistinctive
beak; and 3) robust form. The only other species of small
dolphins with beaks of similar length and general appearance
are the Atlantic white-sided and white-beaked dolphins (p.
123 and 126); these dolphins, both with far more northerly
ranges, have 30-40 and 22-28 teeth in each side of each jaw,
respectively, while Fraser's dolphins have from 40 to 44
teeth in the upper jaw and from 39 to 44 in the lower jaw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<br />
<i>Lagenorhynchus acutus</i> (Gray 1828)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Atlantic white-sided porpoise, jumper (Newfoundland).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Atlantic white-sided dolphins reach about 9 feet (2.7 m) in
maximum length and are robust in form with a small but
distinct beak (less than 2 inches [5.1 cm] long).</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is tall, distinctly back curved, and pointed
on the tip. The tail stock is extremely thick and does not
narrow laterally until very near the tail flukes.</p>

<p>The back is distinctly black, the belly white. The sides
have zones of gray, tan, and white.</p>

<p>The single most distinctive feature of Atlantic white-sided
dolphins is an elongated oval zone of white and yellowish
white along the sides from just below the dorsal fin to the area
above the anus. These patches of lighter coloration, clearly
demarcated from each other and from the surrounding
coloration, are frequently visible simultaneously with the
dorsal fin as the animals roll at the surface to breathe. Even
alone this feature permits positive identification of the
species. The dorsal fin is often part gray, part black. The beak
is all black.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Atlantic white-sided dolphins are known to congregate in
herds of perhaps a thousand animals, though smaller herds
are far more common. The species is often wary of ships and
does not ordinarily ride the bow wave. Like a number of other
species, white-sided dolphins have been reported in
association with Atlantic pilot whales.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>At sea, Atlantic white-sided dolphins are most likely to be

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Atlantic white-sided dolphins are distributed, primarily
offshore, in the cool waters between the Gulf Stream and the
Labrador Current. They have been observed from Hudson
Canyon, off New York City, north to southern Greenland and
perhaps Davis Straits. Their normal range shares a southern
boundary with the white-beaked dolphin but does not extend
as far to the north.</p>

uniformly dark-gray dorsal fin, and a short but distinct beak
which, as the common name implies, is often light gray to
white above and below, at least in European waters. The
beak of animals in the western Atlantic populations is less
frequently white. The back and sides are basically dark gray
to black, and the belly is white to light gray.</p>

<p>Swimming white-beaked dolphins can be most readily
identified by the two areas of pale coloration on the sides, one
in front of and another below and behind the dorsal fin. These
areas are clearly visible from a ship or aircraft as the animals
roll at the surface.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>White-beaked dolphins may sometimes occur in herds of
up to 1,500 individuals. Like their cousins, the Atlantic
white-sided dolphins, they do not commonly ride the bow
waves of vessels.</p>

<p>White-beaked dolphins feed on squid, octopus, cod,
herring, capelin, and sometimes on benthic crustaceans.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>In their northerly range white-beaked dolphins are likely
to be confused with only the Atlantic white-sided dolphins.
The most distinctive features of white-beaked dolphins are 1)
the two areas of paleness described above, 2) the prominent,
dark gray dorsal fin, and sometimes 3) the white beak. Other
features by which the two species may be distinguished in the
brief encounters typical at sea are tabularized on p. <a href="#Page_127">127</a>.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>White-beaked dolphins are the more northerly of the two
species of <i>Lagenorhynchus</i> in the western North Atlantic.
They are found from Cape Cod, Mass., north to western and
southern Greenland and Davis Straits, though they are
apparently far more numerous to the north of this range.
They appear in Davis Straits in spring and summer and leave
that area in autumn, sometimes as late as November, to move
southward. They winter as far south as Cape Cod, where they
are the common dolphin species in April, May, and June
(sometimes to July). Their migrations are poorly known.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded white-beaked dolphins can be most readily
distinguished from white-sided dolphins by the substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins reach a maximum overall
length of about 12 feet (3.7 m) and weigh in excess of 1,430
pounds (650 kg). They have relatively stubby snouts and
dorsal fins, which are broad at the base, tall, and falcate.
Coloration varies slightly, but individuals are usually dark
gray on the back, lighter gray on the side, grading to white or
pink on the belly. Old females may have spots on the belly.
The dark coloration of the back often appears as a highly
distinct cape, particularly on the head.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins often occur in groups of up
to several hundred individuals which usually consist of
aggregations of small groups of no more than a dozen animals
each. They frequently associate with the Atlantic pilot
whales and are frequently found accompanying the right and
humpback whales travelling along the Atlantic coast of
Florida.</p>

<p>Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins have catholic tastes,
feeding on shrimp, eels, catfish, menhadden mullet, and
miscellaneous trash fish, to mention only a few. They are
frequently found near shrimp boats, feeding on fish stirred up
by the trawls or on discarded trash fish.</p>

<p>They sometimes move in to ride the bow wave of a vessel,
turning on their sides, sometimes spinning completely
around on their longitudinal axis when doing so. Individuals
may also turn their heads downward or to the side. They are
often found close to shore, in bays and lagoons, and
sometimes venture up the larger rivers. Some individuals,
especially the larger animals, are found as far offshore as the
edge of the continental shelf. Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins
sometimes ride the surf. Individuals may jump clear of the
water as high as 15-20 feet (4.6-6.1 m), a behavior on which
aquarium shows have capitalized.</p>

<p>Members of this species are the dolphins most commonly
maintained in captivity at zoos, aquariums, marine parks,
and research institutions. For that reason, they are perhaps
more familiar to the general public than any other species of
porpoise, dolphin, or whale.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>From at least Cape Hatteras southward, the range of the
Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins distributed in inshore areas
may overlap with that of Atlantic spotted dolphins,
particularly during the spring and summer, when the
Atlantic spotted dolphins move inshore. There the two
species may be confused. The Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins
and the Atlantic spotted dolphins can be distinguished,
however, by the following characteristics:</p>

dolphins (p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>) or with grampus (p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>). They may be
distinguished from rough-toothed dolphins by the following:</p>

</table>

<p>Distinguishing differences between the Atlantic bottlenosed
dolphins in offshore areas and grampus are tabularized
on p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>.</p>

<p>In northeastern South America the range of the Atlantic
bottlenosed dolphin apparently overlaps with that of the
Guiana dolphin, which, except for size, it closely resembles
(see p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>).</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>The Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins are widely distributed
in the temperate and tropical waters of the western North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
best known from New England southward to Florida,
westward in the Gulf of Mexico, and thence throughout the
West Indies and Caribbean to Venezuela.</p>

<p>In the northern portion of that range, Atlantic
bottlenosed dolphins are distributed offshore. In the
southern portions of their range from at least North Carolina
southward, the majority are found nearshore and often enter
bays and lagoons, and sometimes venture up the larger
rivers. Daily migrations in these areas may follow tidal flow.</p>

<p>In these same southerly areas some Atlantic bottlenosed
dolphins are distributed as far offshore as the edge of the
continental shelf.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Within their range, stranded Atlantic bottlenosed
dolphins should be readily identifiable by 1) the robust body,
2) relatively short beak, and 3) the 20-26 teeth in each upper
jaw and 18-24 in each lower jaw.</p>

<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>None known.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Guiana dolphins are the second smallest cetacean species
in the western North Atlantic, reaching a maximum length of
only about 5.6 feet (1.7 m).</p>

<p>Their body shape is very similar to that of the Atlantic
bottlenosed dolphin, though the beak is less clearly

<i>Steno bredanensis</i> (G. Cuvier in Lesson 1828)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Rough-toothed porpoise, goggle-eyed porpoise.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Rough-toothed dolphins reach a length of at least 8 feet
(2.4 m). The coloration of the rough-toothed dolphins is quite
variable. Individuals are often dark gray to dark purplish
gray on the back with pinkish-white blotches on the sides
and belly. The flippers and flukes are dark and the belly is
white. Individuals are frequently scarred with numerous
white streaks.</p>

<p>The most distinctive characteristic of the rough-toothed
dolphin is its beak, which is quite long and slender, may be
white or pinkish white along both sides, including one or both
lips and the tip of the snout, and is not separated from the
forehead by the transverse groove present in other long-snouted
dolphins. Because the forehead and the sides of the
head slope smoothly into the rostrum, when this animal is
seen from above or from the side, its entire head appears very
long and nearly conical.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>Rough-toothed dolphins occur in small groups of 50
animals or fewer and are usually found off the edge of the
continental slope. They may ride the bow waves.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>In their offshore habitat, rough-toothed dolphins are most
likely to be confused with Atlantic spotted dolphins (p. 104)
and with Atlantic bottlenosed dolphins (p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>). They may
be distinguished from Atlantic spotted dolphins by the
following:</p>

<p>They may be distinguished from Atlantic bottlenosed
dolphins by the characteristics tabularized on p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>.</p>

<p>Even at a distance the blotched coloration of the side and
the white coloration of the rostrum of rough-toothed dolphins
may be visible. If closer examination is possible, the
distinctive shape and coloration of the beak make positive
identification easy.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Though records of rough-toothed dolphins from the
western North Atlantic are scant, the species is assumed to
be widely distributed in deep tropical to warm temperate
waters. It has been reported from Virginia, Georgia, Florida,
the Gulf of Mexico, the West Indies, and off the northeastern
coast of South America.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>In addition to the characteristics listed above for
distinguishing living animals, stranded rough-toothed
dolphins can be readily identified by the fact that the 20-27
fairly large teeth per jaw per side have a series of fine vertical
wrinkles on the crown, a characteristic from which the
species derives its common name. (These wrinkles are often
difficult to detect.)</p>

<p>Slender blackfish, slender pilot whale.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Pygmy killer whales reach a length of about 8-9 feet
(2.4-2.7 m). They are usually relatively slender-bodied with a
rounded head, an underslung jaw, and no beak.</p>

<p>The falcate dorsal fin, located about the center of the back,
is usually between 8 and 12 inches (20.3 and 30.1 cm) tall
(though it may reach 15 inches [38 cm] in some individuals), is
sometimes very distinctive, and resembles that of the
Atlantic bottlenosed dolphin. The flippers are slightly
rounded on the tips.</p>

<p>The color has been described as dark gray or black on the
back, often lighter on the sides, extending higher in front of
the dorsal fin and with a small zone of white on the
underside, often a lighter gray area on the sides, and
distinctive white regions around the lips. The chin may be
completely white. This white zone on the chin, described as
a "goatee," is often clearly visible in swimming animals.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>The pygmy killer whale resembles the false killer whale
but is much smaller and can be distinguished at close range by
the zones of white coloration. False killer whales are almost
all black and reach a length of up to at least 18 feet (5.5 m).
Pygmy killer whales are dark gray on the back, often lighter
on the sides, and show a region of white on the belly which
may extend so high up onto the sides that it is visible on a
swimming animal. Further, they reach only 8-9 feet (2.4-2.7
m).</p>

<p>Pygmy killer whales may also be confused with the
similarly sized and colored many-toothed blackfish. So little is
known of the two species' appearance and behavior at sea that
it is doubtful that they can be successfully distinguished,
though many-toothed blackfish apparently lack the white
region often seen on the sides of pygmy killer whales.
Further, pygmy killer whales have rounded flippers and
smoothly tapered heads, while those of the many-toothed
blackfish are pointed on the tip and more sharply pointed
(often described as a parrot beak).</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Pygmy killer whales are probably distributed in the
tropical and subtropical waters of the western North
Atlantic. They have been reported from Texas, the Atlantic
coast of Florida, and St. Vincent Island, Lesser Antilles.
Records of the species from the other oceans of the world
suggest that its distribution is limited to tropical and
subtropical waters.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded pygmy killer whales can be clearly distinguished
from both the false killer whale and the many-toothed
blackfish. In addition to the differences discussed above, the
following are key differences between the pygmy and false
killer whales:</p>

<h4><a name="MANY-TOOTHED_BLACKFISH_T" id="MANY-TOOTHED_BLACKFISH_T"></a>MANY-TOOTHED BLACKFISH (T)
<br />
<i>Peponocephala electra</i> (Gray 1846)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Hawaiian blackfish, melon-headed whale.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Many-toothed blackfish reach lengths of at least 9 feet (2.7
m) and are similar in body shape to the larger false killer
whale and the similar-sized pygmy killer whale. The body is
elongated and slim with a rather slim tail stock. In general,
the head is shaped like that of the false killer whale but has a
sharper appearance to the snout, sometimes described as
a parrot-beak. The forehead is rounded, slightly overhanging
the lower jaw, and has no beak. The dorsal fin is up to 10
inches (25.4 cm). It is probably very distinctive as the animals
surface to breathe. Many-toothed blackfish are black on the
back and slightly lighter on the belly. The areas around the
anus and genitals and the lips are unpigmented. Many-toothed
blackfish are presumably rare.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Many-toothed blackfish may be confused with either the
false killer whale or the pygmy killer whale. They are
considerably smaller than the false killer whale, have a
slightly more pointed snout, and lack the prominent humplike
forward margin on the flippers which is characteristic of the
false killer whale.</p>

<p>They are approximately the same size as pygmy killer
whales, but the white area around the genitals which extends
up onto the side in pygmy killer whales may be lacking in
many-toothed blackfish. This species has pointed flippers,
while those of pygmy killer whales are rounded on the tips.
Many-toothed blackfish also have a slightly more pointed
snout. Otherwise, the two species are virtually indistinguishable
in encounters at sea.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Although many-toothed blackfish have not yet been
reported in the western North Atlantic, they are included
in this guide because of a record from the eastern tropical
North Atlantic and the known tropical distribution in
other areas.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Stranded many-toothed blackfish can be distinguished
from false killer and pygmy killer whales by the number of
teeth alone. Many-toothed blackfish have more than 15 per
side per jaw (usually 21-25); both other species have
less than 15.</p>

flipper shape (those of this species are pointed while those of pygmy killer whales are rounded on the tip), coloration and body shape of the two species are similar. (<i>Photo courtesy of T. Dohl.</i>)</span>

<h4><a name="PYGMY_SPERM_WHALE_T" id="PYGMY_SPERM_WHALE_T"></a>PYGMY SPERM WHALE (T)
<br />
<i>Kogia breviceps</i> (Blainville 1838)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>None known.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Pygmy sperm whales reach a length of at least 11 feet (3.4
m). They are characterized by 1) an extremely robust body
that rapidly tapers near the tail, 2) a squarish head, and 3) a
narrow, underslung lower jaw which is located well behind
the tip of the snout. Along the side of the head, in
approximately the same position where gill slits would be
located on a fish of comparable size, there is a crescent-shaped
bracket mark, often called a false gill.</p>

<p>The flippers, which are smoothly curved on the forward
margin and may reach a length of 18 inches (45.7 cm) or more
on an adult specimen, are located well forward on the body,
just below and behind the bracket mark.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is very small, falcate, and located in the
latter half of the back.</p>

<p>Though coloration can be described only from stranded
specimens and a few encounters with living animals, pygmy
sperm whales appear to be dark steel gray on the back,
shading to a lighter gray on the sides, and gradually fading to
a dull white on the belly. The outer surface of the flippers and
the upper surface of the tail flukes are also steel gray.</p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>From the few accounts, the following may be summarized
about the behavior of pygmy sperm whales at sea: They
reportedly usually rise slowly to the surface to breathe,
produce a blow that is inconspicuous, and do not normally roll
aggressively at the surface like most other species of small
whales. They reportedly fold their flippers flat against their
bodies when swimming. They have been reported to lie
motionless in the water with the back of the head on the
surface and the tail hanging loosely down in the water. (A
similar behavior in sperm whales has made them a minor
hazard to shipping, since it has resulted in some collisions
with ships.) When they are startled in this posture, they may
defecate, issuing a cloud of reddish brown to rust-colored
fece. Beached pygmy sperm whales have also been observed
to defecate a fine chocolate feces.</p>

<p>Pygmy sperm whales apparently feed primarily on squid,
but do take fish as well.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>In general, when they can be examined at close range,
pygmy sperm whales are so distinctive that they are unlikely
to be confused with any other species except perhaps the
dwarf sperm whales. At a distance, they might be confused
with small individuals of any of the beaked-whale species
(p. <a href="#Page_78">78</a>) that also have a relatively small, falcate dorsal fin
located in the latter third of the back. Closer examination
should permit easy separation, however, since the pygmy
sperm whale has a blunted head, while the beaked whales, as
the name implies, have elongated "dolphinlike" beaks and are
considerably larger. At sea, pygmy sperm whales are most
likely to be confused with their cousins the dwarf sperm
whales (p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a> and Fig. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>). The two species can be distinguished
as follows:</p>

<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Because they have been rarely observed at sea, normal
ranges for this species are not known. Based on stranding
records, however, the following can be stated. In the western
North Atlantic, pygmy sperm whales have been found as far
north as Sable Island, Halifax, Nova Scotia, as far south as
Cuba, and as far west as Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. They are
frequently found stranded along the Atlantic coast of Florida
and throughout the eastern and northern Gulf of Mexico.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Because of the distinctive characters of the genus,
stranded pygmy and dwarf sperm whales are unlikely to be
confused with any other species of cetacean, though the
rather narrow underslung jaw and the blunted head may
result in their casual dismissal by some beach walkers as
stranded sharks. The two species of Kogia may be
distinguished by the following:</p>

<h4><a name="DWARF_SPERM_WHALE_T" id="DWARF_SPERM_WHALE_T"></a>DWARF SPERM WHALE (T)
<br />
<i>Kogia simus</i> (Owen 1866)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Rat porpoise (West Indies).</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Dwarf sperm whales reach an overall length of
approximately 9 feet (2.7 m). Like the other species of <i>Kogia</i>,
the pygmy sperm whale (p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>), the dwarf sperm whales are
characterized by 1) a squarish head, 2) an extremely robust
body which tapers rapidly near the tail stock, 3) a narrow,
underslung lower jaw, and 4) a bracket mark or false gill on
the side of the head.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin of this species is tall and falcate, closely
resembling that of the Atlantic bottlenosed dolphin, and is
located near the midpoint of the back. There are several
short, irregular creases or grooves on the throat similar to
those found on the sperm whale (see Figs. <a href="#Figure_60">60</a>, <a href="#Figure_165">165</a>).</p>

<p>Dwarf sperm whales are dark steel gray on the back,
grading to lighter gray on the sides, and fading to dull white
on the belly.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>Because of their tall, falcate dorsal fin, dwarf sperm
whales may be confused at a distance with any of the small
dolphin species. Their all-black or dark steel-gray coloration
and the blunted head increase the likelihood that they can be
confused with pygmy killer whales or many-toothed
blackfish. They will have to be examined at close range before
they can be distinguished.</p>

<p>Dwarf sperm whales may also be confused with pygmy
sperm whales (p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a> and <a href="#Figure_160">Fig. 160</a>). The two species can
be differentiated by the characteristics tabularized on p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Since it has only recently been recognized as a species
distinct from the pygmy sperm whale and even more recently
given a common name, records of dwarf sperm whales may
have been confused with those of its close relatives. The
dwarf sperm whale has been reported from at least Georgia
south to St. Vincent, Lesser Antilles, and throughout the
eastern and northern Gulf of Mexico. It is highly likely that
this species, like the pygmy sperm whale, extends further to
the north.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>Because of the distinctive characteristics of the genus,
neither species of stranded <i>Kogia</i> is likely to be confused with
any other species. They can be distinguished from one
another by the characteristics tabularized on p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="HARBOR_PORPOISE_T" id="HARBOR_PORPOISE_T"></a>HARBOR PORPOISE (T)
<br />
<i>Phocoena phocoena</i> (Linnaeus 1758)</h4>


<h5>Other Common Names</h5>

<p>Common porpoise, herring hog, puffing pig (Newfoundland
and New England), Pourcils (Quebec), harbour porpoise.</p>


<h5>Description</h5>

<p>The harbor porpoise is the smallest cetacean species in the
western North Atlantic Ocean, reaching a maximum overall
length of about 5 feet (1.5 m). Its most distinctive identifying
features in encounters at sea are 1) the small, chunky body; 2)
the coloration, dark brown or gray on the back, fading to
lighter grayish brown on the sides, often with speckling in the
transition zone, and white on the belly extending farther up
on the sides in front of the dorsal fin; 3) the small rounded
head, lacking a distinctive beak; 4) the small, triangular
dorsal fin; and 5) the shallow, inshore northerly
distribution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>


<h5>Natural History Notes</h5>

<p>As the name implies, the harbor porpoise inhabits bays,
harbors, river mouths, and all the relatively shallow inshore
water between. Though it may travel in schools of nearly a
hundred individuals, it is more often seen in pairs or in small
groups of from 5 to 10 individuals. It often swims quietly at
the surface. It will not ride the bow wave and is very difficult
to approach closely by boat.</p>


<h5>May Be Confused With</h5>

<p>The harbor porpoise is not known to associate with
dolphins but is sometimes seen in close proximity to fin
whales and humpback whales off the Canadian coast in spring
and summer. Because of its northern inshore habitat, the
harbor porpoise is not likely to be confused with any other
cetacean.</p>


<h5>Distribution</h5>

<p>Harbor porpoises are restricted to the colder waters of the
western North Atlantic Ocean. They have been reported
from North Carolina north to the Davis Straits and the waters
of southwestern Greenland. Within this range they are
probably most common in the Bay of Fundy and off southwest
Greenland.</p>


<h5>Stranded Specimens</h5>

<p>In addition to the characteristics described above for
living animals, stranded harbor porpoises can be readily
identified by the small spade-shaped teeth, 22-28 per jaw.</p>

without the cooperation of many people. Of over 450
individuals and scientific organizations contacted in 14
countries, 255 responded to our letters and well over 100
provided photographs for review and selection. We were particularly
pleased that for the majority of the species found in
the western North Atlantic our most difficult problem was
narrowing the choices and ultimately selecting illustrations
from the many good materials made available to us. Although
there are far too many contributors to mention all by name,
their prompt and enthusiastic responses to requests for help
are gratefully acknowledged, whether or not their materials
were used.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_A" id="APPENDIX_A"></a>APPENDIX A
<br />
TAGS ON WHALES, DOLPHINS, AND PORPOISES</h2>


<p>Field studies of cetaceans are very difficult. First, it is
extremely hard to be positive that an individual or a group of
animals is the same from one encounter to the next. This
means that it is nearly impossible to determine, for example,
whether herds of animals are resident in an area or only
seasonal visitors. Without information of this kind,
determinations vital to population management, such as sizes
of populations and natural ranges, are impossible to make.</p>

<p>Secondly, as we frequently point out in this guide,
individual cetaceans are usually visible to a surface observer
only during the brief moments when they break the air-water
interface to breathe. The majority of their vital activities
(e.g., feeding, reproduction, communication, establishing
and maintaining position within the herd, and defending
against natural enemies) take place primarily below the
surface, well out of view to a surface observer.</p>

<p>In recent years, in an attempt to overcome some of these
problems, scientists have been placing markers on various
species of cetaceans and monitoring their movements. The
following brief summary of major methods of tagging
cetaceans is provided to acquaint the reader with markers he
may expect to see in the western North Atlantic.</p>


<h3>Static Tags</h3>

<p>Since their development in the mid-1920's, numerous
Discovery marks (small stainless steel projectiles with
identifying information stamped on them) have been shot into
commercially valuable species by means of a shotgun. The
recovery of these marks from whales subsequently killed in
the whaling industry has provided valuable information on
the movement patterns and on basic aspects of the growth
and development of harvested species of whales. Discovery
marks are limited, however, because they are not visible in a
living animal. Reduction in whaling activities will bring about
a significant reduction in their use.</p>

<p>More recent tagging developments relate to marks which
will be visible on a free-swimming animal. Large whales, for
instance, may be tagged with color-coded streamers, such as
that shown in <a href="#Figure_A2">Appendix Figure A2</a>. The tags, which are
modified versions of the spaghetti tags first constructed for
use on fishes, consist of a small stainless steel head for
attachment to the blubber and a colorful streamer (sometimes
stamped with information on agencies to which tags should
be returned) which is visible above the surface of the animal.
These tags may be applied by using either a pole applicator or
a crossbow and crossbow bolts. Both applicators are equipped
with a stop to limit the depth of penetration into the animal's
blubber. Extensive experimentation indicates that the tags
do not harm the animals and that their application is not
traumatic. With the continued reduction in whaling activity,
it is hoped that the use of such markers in the study of
movements of big whales will be increased.</p>

<p>Because they often ride the bow wave of a moving vessel,
thereby making themselves accessible for tagging and
capture, small porpoises and dolphins have been tagged with
a greater variety of marks than large whales. In recent years,
at least three kinds of static tags, including spaghetti
streamers, have been placed on small and medium-sized
cetaceans.</p>

<p>Spaghetti tags, placed in the animal's blubber near the
base of the dorsal fin as it rides the bow wave, stream to
conform to the contour of the animal's body as it swims (<a href="#Figure_A3">App.
Fig. A3</a>). It is not possible to identify the numbers on the
spaghetti tag of a moving animal, although color codes may be
used to indicate different species, populations, or tagging
areas.</p>

<p>Button tags and freeze brands are placed on captured
animals prior to their release. The button tags (App. Figs.
<a href="#Figure_A4">A4</a>, <a href="#Figure_A5">A5</a>) are placed in the dorsal fin and should be visible as the
animal surfaces to breathe or as it rides the bow wave. At
close range, the number, letter, or design may also be visible.
Freeze brands (<a href="#Figure_A6">App. Fig. A6</a>) are placed on the back or dorsal
fin with a supercooled branding iron, apparently without pain
or discomfort to the animal, and provide a permanent mark
which leaves the tagged animal free of encumbrances. The
use of freeze brands shows promise and should come into
more extensive use.</p>

<p>Other static tagging techniques currently under
investigation include the use of laser beams to apply small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
brands and the use of gas branding devices. Neither
technique, however, has yet reached the field biologist.</p>

<p>The success of any tagging program using static tags
depends on the resighting of tagged animals and the recovery
of tags. For that reason, we appeal to readers to be on the
lookout for tagged animals and to report sightings to one of
the authors.</p>

<h3>Radio Transmitter Tags</h3>

<p>In recent years, radio transmitter tags have been
developed for use on marine mammals. As they continue to
become more reliable, these tags are expected to come into
more and more widespread use.</p>

<p>Early radio tags (<a href="#Figure_A7">Fig. A7</a>) were simple locator beacons
which permitted the animal to be tracked by sending a signal
to a tracking vessel or aircraft every time the animal surfaced
and the antenna tip was exposed. Even these basic packages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
provide important information on movement, activity
patterns, and respiration rates.</p>

<p>Subsequent developments have involved the addition of
sensors to monitor the maximum depth of each dive and
environmental parameters such as the water temperature at
that depth (<a href="#Figure_A8">Fig. A8</a>).</p>

<p>Logical extensions of these developments include the
addition of numerous other sensors to permit simultaneous
monitoring of multiple aspects of the animal's environment
and the transmission of these data first to aircraft and
subsequently to satellites for relay to shore-based
laboratories.</p>

<p>In addition to permitting scientists to define movement
patterns and daily diving patterns of cetaceans, the use of
such devices offers an exciting means of determining the
environmental parameters that trigger changes in their
behavior.</p>

<p>Radio transmitter tags, in a variety of configurations,
may be constructed and attached for short-term studies or for
long-term monitoring of migrating animals. In either case,
depending on their size and methods of attachment, radio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
transmitter tags may be visible on a free-swimming animal

<h3>Natural Markings</h3>

<p>In addition to these man-made and applied tags,
variations in natural markings and unusual appearances may
be used to identify individuals and herds on repeated
encounters. Although many species of cetaceans are
characterized by changes in color pattern with age,
individuals occasionally differ radically in their coloration
from their fellows (App. Figs. <a href="#Figure_A9">A9</a>, <a href="#Figure_A10">A10</a>). In addition, individuals
are sometimes seen with unusually shaped dorsal fins or
scarring patterns (App. Fig. <a href="#Figure_A11">A11</a>). These unusually marked
animals should stand out in repeated encounters and can be a
help in identifying a herd from one encounter to another.</p>

<p>Obviously, this list of tags and anomalous markings is not
exhaustive. New marks may be developed at any time. The
discussion is intended to make the reader aware of the value
of information on natural or man-made marks in studies of
cetacean natural history. Your cooperation will perhaps help
us to unravel some of the mystery surrounding the
distribution and movements of porpoises, dolphins, and
whales.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B"></a>APPENDIX B
<br />
RECORDING AND REPORTING OBSERVATIONS OF CETACEANS AT SEA</h2>


<p>To increase reliability of identifications, observers should
train themselves to ask the following kinds of questions each
time cetaceans are encountered:</p>

<ul><li>1. How large was the animal?</li>

<li>2. Did it have a dorsal fin? If so, what was its size, shape,
and position on the animal's back?</li>

<li>3. Was the animal's blow visible? If so, how tall did it
appear? What was its shape? How frequently did the animal
blow?</li>

<li>4. What was the animal's color and color pattern?</li>

<li>5. Did it have any highly distinctive markings?</li>

<li>6. If it was a large or medium-sized animal, did it show its
tail flukes when it began its dive?</li>

<li>7. If it was a medium-sized or small animal, did it
approach, avoid, or ignore the vessel? Did it ride the bow
wave?</li>

<li>8. What was its behavior? Did it jump from the water? If
so, did it make a smooth graceful arching jump, or did it spin,
somersault, or reenter with a splash?</li></ul>

<p>One characteristic is rarely sufficient by itself, and the
greater amount of relevant evidence the observer can obtain,
the greater the likelihood he can make a reliable
identification. But it is important to remember that even the
most experienced cetologists are often unable to make an
identification. Therefore, even if you cannot positively
identify an animal or even make a good guess as to its
identity, do not hesitate to fill out the rest of the sighting
record form and submit it to an appropriate office. Listing the
characters you observe and filling in as much of the form as
possible may enable a cetologist to make an identification
based on those characters and his knowledge of the
distribution, movements, and behavior of cetaceans. In this
regard, a sketch made as soon as possible after the encounter
and photographs taken from as many angles as possible will
aid in the identification.</p>

<p>Two sample sighting reports are provided to demonstrate
a method of recording observations. The first report,
"Sighting Information," is completed as an example and is
footnoted for explanation. The second report, "Cetacean
Data Record." located at the end of the guide, is blank and
may be photocopied in bulk for use in the field. Copies of this
or similar forms are available from any of the authors or from
National Marine Fisheries Service, Tiburon, Calif. Even if no
form is available, however, observations should be recorded
in rough form, in as much detail as possible.</p>

<p>Reliable intermittent reports of cetaceans are of interest
to cetologists. Their locations indicate seasonality of
distribution, and their frequencies help indicate relative
abundances of the various species. Because scientists are
attempting to determine areas in which cetaceans are often,
occasionally, seldom, or never found, and are ultimately
describing why animals are found in one area and not another,
persons who want to go a step further in their participation in
observer programs may want to keep and report records of
their entire cruise tracks and zones in which vigilance was
maintained but no cetaceans were observed. Data obtained in
this manner may be used as the foundation of estimates of
cetacean populations, estimates which are extremely difficult
to obtain by any other method.</p>

<p>To be of maximum use in such calculations, however,
records of this kind <i>must</i> include the following minimum
information: time and location of beginning and ending of
each continuous watch, weather conditions as they affect
visibility, sea state, ship's speed, height of the observer(s)
above the water, number of persons on watch, and details of
each sighting, particularly the estimated distance of the
animal(s) from the ship's track.</p>

<p>For a sample of a fictional continuous watch report might
look like the following. If sighting forms are available, these
observations may be recorded directly onto them. Additional
information can be recorded on the opposite side of the
forms.</p>

<br />
STRANDED WHALES, DOLPHINS, AND PORPOISES
<br />
With a Key to the Identification of Stranded Cetaceans of the Western North Atlantic</h2>


<h3>Stranded Animals</h3>

<p>As we discussed briefly in the introduction to this guide,
whales, dolphins, and porpoises sometimes "strand" or
"beach" themselves, individually or in entire herds, for a
complex of still incompletely understood reasons. Though the
reasons suggested for these strandings appear almost as
numerous as the strandings themselves, two tenable
generalizations have recently been proposed.</p>

<p>Strandings of lone individuals usually involve an animal
which is sick or injured. Mass strandings, involving from
several to several hundred individuals, appear to be far more
complex and may result from fear reactions, from extremely
bad weather conditions, from herd-wide disease conditions,
or from failure of the echolocation system due to physiological
problems or environmental conditions which combine to
reduce its effectiveness, to mention only a few.</p>

<p>Whatever their causes, however, cetacean strandings
usually attract crowds and elicit much public interest and
sympathy. There are frequently attempts to save the lives of
the animals involved.</p>

<p>Individually stranded cetaceans rarely survive, even if
they are found soon after stranding and transported to
adequate holding facilities. This does not mean that every
attempt should not be made to save them.</p>

<p>In mass strandings, some individuals may be entirely
healthy, and if they are found soon enough after stranding,
properly protected and transported, and correctly cared for
in the initial few days after collection, they may survive in
captivity. Attempts to rescue all the animals in a mass
stranding by towing them out to sea have almost always been
frustrating because the animals usually swim repeatedly
back onto the beach.</p>

<p>If you discover a stranding and before you become
involved in an attempt to save a live stranded animal or to
collect data from a dead one, you should be aware of the
following:</p>

<p><b>Marine mammals are currently protected by law.</b> Under
provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, it is
unlawful for persons without a permit to handle, harass, or
possess any marine mammal. It is within the authority of
State officials and employees of the National Marine
Fisheries Service to arrange for the care of live animals
through certified institutions, such as many of those listed in
Appendix E. (Even if the animals were not protected by law,
any impulse to take them to backyard swimming pools, for
instance, should be tempered by the knowledge that their
chances of survival are far greater in an institution with the
facilities and expertise to properly care for them.) The best
general rule is to notify the nearest State or National Marine
Fisheries Service office. If you prefer, however, you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
contact one of the institutions listed in the appendix and ask
them to handle the situation. Some will already have permits
to investigate strandings. Most will be anxious to help.</p>

<p>Although <i>you cannot remove the animal from the beach
without a permit</i>, you can help keep it alive until it can be
removed. Here are a few hints. <b>While waiting for help to
arrive, endeavor to keep the animal as comfortable as
possible. If it is not too large and surf conditions permit, it
should be removed to shallow water where it is barely afloat.</b>
The buoyancy of the water will reduce the stress to the animal
and will help to keep it cool and prevent overheating&mdash;a real
danger to stranded cetaceans.</p>

<p>Whether or not the animal can be floated, <b>care should be
taken to protect it from sunburn, drying out, and
overheating. If it is afloat, exposed parts should be frequently
splashed down. If it is high and dry, it should be covered with
damp cloth, particularly on the dorsal fin, flippers, and
flukes, and the body and the terrain should be frequently
watered to prevent the animal from overheating in the areas
in contact with the sand or rock.</b></p>

<p><b>In any case, be careful to leave the blowhole free so that
the animal can breathe. Note also that the eyes are
particularly sensitive and susceptible to injury; they should
be covered with a wet cloth and treated with special care.</b></p>

<p>With luck, this careful handling will be rewarded with the
animal's being picked up and transported to an aquarium,
where it can receive proper attention. But even <b>if the animal
cannot be saved, collection and examination of the carcass can
provide valuable information to scientists working on the
biology of cetaceans, or on such problems as their disease
conditions and the effects of environmental pollutants on
them. Dead stranded cetaceans even in advanced stages of
decomposition are also an important source of materials for
museum study and display. Therefore, every attempt should
be made to get the carcass into the best hands. Dead
cetaceans, like the live ones, are protected by law and may
not be removed without a permit.</b> The procedure for
obtaining permission to collect them is the same as that
outlined for live strandings. The majority of the institutions
along the western North Atlantic coast will respond to calls
about live or dead strandings. Even if you are unable to
contact an appropriate official, you can still collect some
valuable information by identifying the specimen, using the
following key, and by collecting measurements (see
<a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">Appendix Figure C1.&mdash;Whales and dolphins, like this mixed school of false killer whales and bottlenosed dolphins, sometimes strand themselves

<hr />


<h3>Identifying the Animal</h3>

<p>Cetaceans may be found during or shortly after the
stranding or many months later, when the carcass is bloated
or rotted nearly beyond recognition. If the stranded animal is
alive or freshly dead, it can be identified by any of the
characteristics itemized in the text. But even if it is in an
advanced stage of decomposition it can be identified using the
key below. In general numbers and descriptions of teeth
(<a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a>) and numbers and descriptions of baleen plates
(<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>) persist longest as reliable identifying characteristics.
If they are still detectable on the carcass, numbers and
lengths of ventral grooves may also be used to separate the
balaenopterine whales.<a name="FNanchor_17_20" id="FNanchor_17_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_20" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_20" id="Footnote_17_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_20"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The tables were prepared primarily from Tomilin (1967) and
supplemented by miscellaneous published papers and our own
observations. The sections on toothed whales in the key were developed
following the general outline of Moore (1953).</p></div>

<p>In order to use the key below, begin with the first pair of
opposing characteristics&mdash;one of the two will apply to the
specimen you are examining. On the line following that statement
there will be a paragraph number, go to that paragraph.
There you will find two more paired, opposing characteristics.
Again, one of the two will apply to the specimen you are examining.
Select that one and go to the paragraph indicated on
the line following it. Continue this procedure until the statement
which is true for your specimen is followed by a species
name instead of a reference to another paragraph. This name
identifies the specimen. To verify your identification go to the
discussion of that species in the text. With a little practice and
careful attention to details, identification of whales,
dolphins, and porpoises will become easier.</p>

<br />
RECORDING AND REPORTING DATA ON STRANDED CETACEANS</h2>


<p>So that measurements of cetaceans taken at different
times and at widely divergent locations can be compared, the
measurements and the methods of taking them have been
standardized, although there is still some disagreement
about which of the measurements are most important. The
data form located at the end of this guide, usable on both
baleen and toothed whales, includes all the measurements
routinely taken by cetologists plus a few new ones the authors
consider important. The form and the directions for taking
measurements are synthesized from those currently in use by
the Naval Undersea Center, San Diego; the Fisheries
Research Board of Canada; the University of Rhode Island;
the University of Florida; the U.S. National Museum,
Washington, D.C.; and the National Marine Fisheries
Service, La Jolla, Calif.</p>

<p>Data on stranded cetaceans should be collected by
someone experienced in handling and measuring cetaceans.
The legal problems associated with collection of a specimen
are discussed in <a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a>. In addition to having a permit or
knowing how to obtain permission to collect the specimen,
persons active in cetacean research will usually have access to
laboratory facilities where in-depth studies, including
postmortem examinations and collection of tissues for
specialized laboratory examinations, can be conducted.
Furthermore, specialized equipment, and the number of
steps required to do a complete job with the specimen, make
the procedure prohibitive for most noncetologists. Diligent
attempts should be made to contact one of the institutions
listed in <a href="#APPENDIX_E">Appendix E</a>. If no one is available and no permit or
approval is obtainable, you are limited to photographing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
sketching, and measuring the specimen without removing
the carcass or any part of the carcass from the beach.</p>

<p>Any person taking data on stranded cetaceans should
follow the instructions itemized below, being careful to take
measurements in the manner prescribed and to record data in
as much detail as possible.</p>

<hr />

<p>1. Specimens should be preserved in 10% neutral
Formalin, except for the stomach contents, which should be
kept in 70% ethyl or 40% isopropyl alcohol, or be frozen.
Commercial rubbing alcohol will suffice. As a minimum, the
head, flippers, and reproductive tract should be preserved. If
no other method of handling the specimen is available, and
only as a last resort, it may be buried in the sand well above
the high tide line and carefully marked so it can later be
recovered. Burying usually results in the loss of some vital
parts.</p>

<p>2. The carcass should be examined for external parasites
particularly in such areas as the blowhole(s), the eyes, any
wounds on the trailing edges of the dorsal fin, flippers, and
flukes. Occasionally barnacles will be found on teeth or baleen
plates. Like the stomach contents, parasites should be
preserved in alcohol.</p>

<p>3. Photographs and sketches are a valuable part of data
collection&mdash;views of the animal(s) from as many angles as
possible, and detailed shots of such features as baleen plates,
mouth and teeth, ventral grooves, flippers, flukes, and
unusual scars or coloration should be included. Including a
ruler for size reference may be helpful.</p>

<p>4. Although scientific data are usually expressed in metric
units, measurements should be taken in whatever units are
readily available. All measurements should be taken in a
straight line, as shown in the diagram, unless otherwise
noted. Measurements which refer to the rostrum are taken
from the tip of the upper jaw. The external auditory meatus
(ear) is a small inconspicuous opening located just below and
behind the eye. To locate the ear the observer must
sometimes scrape away some of the skin to expose the
unpigmented ear canal beneath it.</p>

<p>5. Throat grooves are short grooves found on the throat of
beaked whales, sperm whales, and dwarf sperm whales.
Ventral grooves are long grooves found only on
balaenopterine whales. Ventral grooves should be counted
between the flippers.</p>

<hr />


<p>It is difficult to overstress the importance of data from
stranded cetaceans. For some species, the only data available
have come from stranded individuals. By carefully gleaning
from each specimen all the data that can be collected, you will
make a valuable addition to the body of knowledge on these
elusive animals.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_E" id="APPENDIX_E"></a>APPENDIX E
<br />
LIST OF INSTITUTIONS TO CONTACT REGARDING STRANDED CETACEANS</h2>


<p>The following list includes many of the institutions in the
area covered by this guide, which are likely to respond to
calls about stranded cetaceans. The institutions on the
mainland are listed roughly in order from north to south,
following the contour of the coast. Several island institutions
and organizations are also listed.</p>

<p>These institutions are the ones that come to mind as
having taken an active interest in cetacean strandings in the
recent past. In addition to these, almost any university
biology or zoology department, State or Federal conservation
agency or marine laboratory, or local natural history
museum or society can recommend an interested biologist if
no staff member is interested. Such organizations are widely
distributed on or near the coasts and are usually adequately
listed in local telephone directories.</p>

<p>It should be obvious that organizations such as oceanaria
are the most likely ones to be interested in live animals on an
emergency basis. Even so, these organizations often
cooperate with biologists with whom they are familiar and so
will pick up dead animals for them as well. Conversely,
museums and the like are most interested in the dead animals
as they have no facilities for handling live ones. Nevertheless,
they often cooperate with institutions equipped to handle live
animals and will usually help in making arrangements for
picking up the live ones. Therefore, rather than the finder's
making a decision as to whether or not an institution should
be called because the animal is alive or dead, we would urge
that the nearest organization in the following list be contacted
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Space is provided at the end of the list for additions of
contacts inadvertently overlooked in compiling this list, or of
institutions which come into being after its publication.</p>

National Marine Fisheries Service, Circulars</h2>


<p>The major responsibilities of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are to monitor and assess the abundance and geographic distribution of fishery
resources, to understand and predict fluctuations in the quantity and distribution of these resources, and to establish levels for optimum use of the resources.
NMFS is also charged with the development and implementation of policies for managing national fishing grounds, development and enforcement of domestic
fisheries regulations, surveillance of foreign fishing off United States coastal waters, and the development and enforcement of international fishery agreements
and policies. NMFS also assists the fishing industry through marketing service and economic analysis programs, and mortgage insurance and vessel construction
subsidies. It collects, analyzes, and publishes statistics on various phases of the industry.</p>

<p>The NOAA Technical Report NMFS CIRC series continues a series that has been in existence since 1941. The Circulars are technical publications of general interest
intended to aid conservation and management. Publications that review in considerable detail and at a high technical level certain broad areas of research appear in this
series. Technical papers originating in economics studies and from management investigations appear in the Circular series.</p>

<p>NOAA Technical Reports NMFS CIRC are available free in limited numbers to governmental agencies, both Federal and State. They are also available in
exchange for other scientific and technical publications in the marine sciences. Individual copies may be obtained (unless otherwise noted) from D83, Technical
Information Division, Environmental Science Information Center, NOAA. Washington, D.C. 20235. Recent Circulars are:</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
